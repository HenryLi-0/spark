# 10/25/2025 - 3rd Update!

ok, this has been in the back of my mind lately, but here's some updates! first, i got solder paste at micro center today, pretty cool store (unforunately, i was half blind today because i forgor to wear contacts last night and forgor to bring my glasses), people were pretty nice, i mightve given the cashier guy the wrong email oops

anyways, solder paste and a kg of both red and white filament (PLA+) each, so that's cool! unfrotunately, i have no idea where to put it. anyways, back to the project!

today, we steal the moon! just kidding, we're going to onshape and using KrayonCAD (which is meant for frc robots) to make simple mock up of how mechanisms will be sliding by each other! 5:00 PM in NYC, and getting on onshape! nvm its actually 5:15 PM, had to find a place to put this filament

ok, 5:52 PM, this took weirdly long, but here:

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202510/10252025 - 1.png>)

we are facing the front, the purple generic gamepieces represent the motor and tool head, the green belts represent motion systems (rails, rods, etc.), the orange main frame represents the main frame, and the top orange frame (smaller) represents the tool head storage. the orange slab in the center represents the print bed, and the lower orange frame (near the back) represents a fan exhaust!

ok, now, the original plan was to go for 50cm x 50cm, but in retrospect, thats way larger than i need, so the full frame will be roughly 30cm x 30cm (note, outside perimeter, NOT build plate size)

ok, 6:00 PM, lets look at last log's plans!


- State the objective
    - The objective is to create a 3D motion system with a clear path to multipurpose toolheads. Currently, the plan is to have an automatic tool swap system. 
- Detail (qualitative and quanitative) what we want
    - A CoreXY motion system
    - A normal Z system with a ~20cm x 20cm build plate
    - Automatic Tool Changes 
- Start drafting a rough BOM
    - Motion
        - x4 NEMA Stepper Motors
            - 2 for CoreXY, 1 for Z, 1 for extruder
        - Belts
            - GT2 belts, some long ones for corexy
        - Linear Rods
            - 2 for x, 2 for y, 4 for z
        - Screw Lift
            - 1 for Z
    - Structure
        - Probably 20mm x 20mm aluminum extrusions for everything
        - some 3d printed brackets for extra support
        - and all the screws and nuts and things
    - Filament
        - if it fits in the BOM, it would be nice, but i might need like a lot?
    - Electronics
        - Motherboard
            - idk, might custom design?
        - PSU
            - idk, will NOT custom design
        - Fan
            - really, any fan. with mounting holes.
- Decide what to design (firmware, etc.)
    - TBD

so, what goes into making a GOOD electornics motherboard for a 3d printer? because, afaik, its just, motion control (probably some good PID, yes, i know they are stepper motors), parsing G code, proper cooling, proper power distribution, and that's really it? gotta do some research to find out what i dont know, but as far as i can tell, its the slicer that writes the music for the 3d printer to orchestrate.

hmm, from what i can find:
- high clock speed
- good amount of flash/RAM
- of course, we need dedicated stepper driver ICs
- probably something about denoiseing
- i need to read on microstepping
- "isolating EMI" (ngl, ill probably forget about this since it really isn't too too important)
- power distrubtion (no way, is that an FRC reference???)
- fuses etc.
- PROPER COOLING!!!

what about software?
- pretty important, since mechanical stuff can be cool, but if the firmware sucks, well...
- motion control! (reads g code ahead to smooth acceleration and decelerations, etc.)
- reliable step generation (need to read into this)
- well tuned PID for all sort of things (heat elements)
- does the math stuff
- fail safes, error reporting, config saving, and timers
- some monitoring thing

you know what, yeah lets try doing this (what can possibly go wrong), for motherboard, itll certainly be a mix of microcontrollers and stepper motors (because i dont really want to enter the world of the chips themselves just yet), and connected through some PCB. code stuff is probably gonna be mostly custom?

ok, its 6:36 PM, gotta go to dinner! quick commit!

so its 12:53 AM now, good night (hopefully gonna start cadding tomorrow if im not too busy?), ok, good night!
