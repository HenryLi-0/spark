# 10/19/2025 - 2nd Update!

it's been a week... i was gonna start this log in a funny creepy robotics sort of way, but i think ill save creative stuff for later! so, at 12:30 AM on 10/20/2025, what am i doing here?

so for the last week, ive been watching a couple lovely videos on youtube related to 3d printing, and just CNC (general) machines in general. also, from now on, when i say cnc, just assume i mean general cnc machines, unless the context means cnc milling (i sometimes just say cnc instead of milling but whatever)

here's the nice videos!
- dr d flo (thanks, videos were very entertaining)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qub5chyIQ0s
        - goes over a lot of "beginner but not moron" topics, i think i have an idea of what im doing?
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbo6soXn_kQ
        - we're not making a plasma cutter, but its nice to see these ideas implemented once again
- other channels
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuAN5AzEWCg
        - this isnt exactly a tutorial, but it sorta touches on coreXY a bit, and gives some design ideas
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f94CnlQ0eq4
        - ive watched this guys videos since i was a kid im feeling so much nostalgia
        - anyways, jared owens animation basically describing parts of a Bambu Lab A1, not too useful, but does give some idea on how to make this all work

and of course, gotta state that none of these are straight on tutorials for exactly how to build one, but instead just describes how they work and give examples!

so now, i know what a NEMA 17 motor is! well, what NEMA means! ok, so here's what we need to do. taking from memories working on designing `raven` (i will be going to home depot tomorrow to look for electronics solder paste. the quest on their website has not been looking fun. also, hotplate arrived!), sticking to the BOM is kinda important (for budget purposes), along with defining project scope (see last log), and STICKING TO A SCHEDULE AND ACTUALLY WORKING ON THINGS AAAAA

also, quick side topic, i finished drawing a thing woo, also, those videos amounted to roughly 4 hours of research

ok ok ok, quick walkthrough on materials stuff. also, yeah, this thing serves as my ranting space, the journals and stuff are just the condensed versions. anyways, materials. so, for the main structure, 30x30 or 20x20 aluminum extrusions, of course, with either inner triangle brackets or top bracket thingies to keep everything together, and T or V nuts there and there. however, im not sure if i should 3D print the brackets. on one hand, it would bring down the costs to a safer level (going exactly at the $400 mark is VERY dangerous imo), but the structure might go *wiggly wobbly wiggly wobbly ooOOoooOOOOO* **wooOAoOAAAAAAAH** ok im gonna stop. point is, i might need to use a ton of filament, or jsut use on of those triangle corner thingies.

gotta type fast, they be trying to make me go to sleep. anyways, i had the idea the other day of using two z axises to add a fourth degree of rotation. this, obviously, was a pretty bad idea, especially since this is the first printer thing im making, so, we are not gonna do that. now, we're only gonna be using one extruder/tool head thing at a time. also, yeah, about that.

im considering shrinking our project scope. a cnc mill and 3d printer in one piece would be real nice, but the priority of this project is to make a multi tool head thing 3d printer. basically, what im trying to say is 3d printer wow wow is the main goal, and cnc mill would be a nice side addition. however, ill try to keep cnc mill at the back of my mind, so when the time comes, it should be simple to implement.

right, now i was about to talk about power. lets aim for maybe four or five tool thing slots (idk if im using the terminology right, but i mean extruder + nozzle), we'll see how many tools we can fit in the budget. technically, each extruder only needs to run when we are printing with that nozzle, so we should be ok on that (it might just mess with time and whatever).

so, im not gonna walk through all the things from the video, these are just some significant bits i thought were worth sharing. also this afternoon, i thought "hey building this in minecraft would be pretty cool", then realized that "hold up, this aint parametric at all"!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202510/10192025 - 1.png>)

maybe ill work on that, but for now, we're doing it in onshape! first, i will need to look back through all the old CADs, since it has been a bit since i did huge cad projects in onshape... yeah idk, nothing really compares to this?

ok, guess this project really is jumping into the deep end? (i have some clue on how to get started, but anyways, here we go!) so, that's gonna be a tomorrow thing. oh wait, its 1:12 AM, oh thats some strong winds from outside, let's quickly draft a schedule, each deadline ends when the next "phase" starts!

- 10/12/2025: Research
    - Research (figure out what we need to do, figure out what we do know and what we dont)
- 10/19/2025: Planning
    - State the objective
    - Detail (qualitative and quanitative) what we want
    - Start drafting a rough BOM
    - Decide what to design (firmware, etc.)
    - Start CADing
- 10/26/2025: CAD
    - Work on general frame
    - Work on concepts (docking), positionings (where things are), etc.
- 11/02/2025: CAD (continued) and Hardware Research (electronics)
    - Work on tool heads, start picking parts (motors, fans, etc.)
    - Start optimizing for weight and budget!
- 11/09/2025: Programming Research and Programming
    - Figure out what we're going to do for firmware
    - Finalize plan for how programming will go
    - Start setting up a firmware for it
- 11/16/2025 - Buffer Week
- 11/23/2025 - Buffer Week
- 11/30/2025 - SUBMISSION DAY (12/1/2025 current deadline)

ok, so, in the ambitious deadline, we're looking to finish this mid-November! of course, things will probably be dragged out, but hopefully we get this done by then! and that i finish `raven` too... but yeah! ok, good plans, its 1:24 AM now, good night!
