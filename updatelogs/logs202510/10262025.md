# 10/26/2025 - 4th Update!

it's 12:32 AM on 10/27/2025, but let's get started anyways! gonna start creating defining sketches on onshape!

ok, its 1:13 AM now, not alot of writing here (thats kinda expected, lots of CAD talking is in the head, and the repository size would explode if i added every thought and screenshot), but here's what we have so far!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202510/10262025 - 1.png>)

its not much right now, and a lot of stuff is still undefined (see the blue thing next to the sketches on the left panel), but trying to keep with good cad practices! this will be a mastersketch file structure, where we'll have:

- Mastersketch
- Subsystems (yes i know, not really)
    - Frame/Structure
    - Tool Carriage + X axis
    - Tool
    - Y axis
    - Belt System
    - Z axis and Print Bed
    - Docking Area
- Final Assembly
- KrayonCAD
- Any Imports
    - Imports

so yeah, for now, let's use the terminology that a tool carriage is the "tool head", without the tool, so its just as if a plate was moving around. then, we "equip" it with a "tool", which is an extuder and stuff. this occurs at the dock, where stuff gets exchanged and stuff! 

ok well, that's it for today! 1:19 AM, wow, this week has no breaks? hmm might need to do some funny scheduling... ok, good night!
