# 10/1/2025 - 1st Update!

yup, after 2 weeks, im back! this is arc 3 of year 2, following [`raven`](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/raven) and [`vectors`](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/vectors)!

so what's this one about? well, recently, ive been pretty fairly unmotivated and havent really been doing lots of the programming and CAD stuff i usually do. not sure exactly why, might be a mix of being unmotivated and just not knowing "what's next". so here's whats next.

[blueprint](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/461), a hackclub YSWS, has recently started. this lasts until December 1st, which is actually pretty neat, since i have 6 weeks to build out one (or two???) projects. now, absolutely no one knows this except for me, but this isn't the first time ive had the concept of `spark`, well, at least in its past form. that old idea never happened (well, in retrospect, it was very poorly timed), but this version is significantly different, both in complexity and an expansion of purpose

ok, what are we talking about here? i was thinking of what i wanted to make for blueprint, then looked across my table to my Bambu Lab A1 Mini all the way back to arcade (this is arc 1 year 1 stuff). one of the downsides of what i did with the doubloons from High Seas was that i spent in things that didn't help me create more. sure, two raspbery pi zero 2w and a raspberry pi 5 are pretty neat, but im not doing much with them. so yeah, they both sit in a little cabinet over there. i realized what i wanted was something that helps me create.

and what better than something that can do almost all that?

the idea of spark is that a lot of creation process for stuff involves some sort of precise manufacturing, it be 3d printing, cnc milling, or placing objects. what if you slapped all this together and made it one unit, with automatic (or at least, possible) tool exchanging, so that you could press build and have it process? additionally, it cleans up your desk space so that you dont need a bunch of machines.

this is also a pretty good challenge for me, since the problem here once again involves programming, CAD, and electrical stuff. (i WILL finish `raven` one day. it's been sitting for like 2 months, but i am REALLY bad at soldering these LEDs. waiting for a reflow station from summer of making, along with going to home depot or something to get some solder paste)

ok, so let's define the scope of this project, so we know how much we want to chew. oops why is gradle trying to build this md file

---

- the core setup
    - 3d frame (rectangular prism)
        - MUST be rigid enough for moving everything quickly
    - coreXY from XY motion
        - faster, cleaner, and lighter moving mass (no motor on X/Y)
        - unforunately needs way more precision in creating and alignment
    - z axis
        - build plate moves up and down
    - swappable bed/toolplate
        - manual swap for now, might be automatic/hot-swap later, but safety and complexity is kinda a bit hard for this
- tool heads
    - 3d printing head
        - erm something bowden, i forgor research from infill
    - cnc milling head
        - this is very simply a motor spin spin spin
        - in more detail, probably a very small spindle (low mass, low power, faster speed, less womp womp?)
    - docking system
        - bank system that swaps with the printer head, see drawing for more detail!
        - this may be manual for now, but that would not be cool
    - electrical considerations
        - toolhead power should ideally be seperate from the main machine, but this is unlikely
        - probably some sort of pin connection to do controls
        - this is more of a future docking concern
- electronics
    - controller
        - some board capable of doing control, probably a raspberry pi, maybe with klipper? (or custom firmware???)
    - driver
        - tmc2209 sounded cool, will do more future research
    - firmware
        - heard klipper and marlin were good, future research (or custom???)
    - connection
        - previously mentioned in tool heads, but some sort of easy (magnetic?) connector for each tool head
- buildplate
    - printing
        - heated bed (removable) with a standard print surface
    - milling
        - random board that can be destroyed (its gonna be milled into)
    - swap method
        - manual for now
- safety
    - mechanical
        - clamps and gussets, low mass toolheads, stable stuff (no wiggly wobbly)
    - electrical
        - since we're connecting to the wall (probably), we dont want to explode. aka, proper electrical concerns (i also dont want to burn down my house)
    - thermal
        - temperature detection here and there
    - dust/small particles
        - ~~the lungs filter the air right?~~
        - some fan at the back of the whole setup to vaccumm everything, along with shields (polycarb or something) to stop things from blowing out

challenges? oh, yes, theres way too many challenges for this. a cnc machine (not for milling only, i mean general cnc machines) is quite easy to make, at least conceptually, but is hard to make WELL. you can't have floppy movements, and 3d printing and stuff requires really really really precise movements. luckly, i estimate to 5 places after the decimals when writing solutions on tests (this got me points off in chemistry, but not physics (this is not educational advice))

anyways, for now, i think we defined the scope pretty well. leds here, leds there, thats ok. but for now, its probably sketch time right? well, just got a new pen nib for my drawing tablet! (thanks arcade!), so lets get drawing! its also 1:03 AM (started at 12:23 AM! also, yes, it's the early morning of 10/13/2025).

ok jokes on you, its kinda too late for this, im gonna go to bed. but picture this, big frame, clear tinted enclosure around an aluminum frame thing, with a little bank above storing a row of tool heads, with attachement stuff for more things (filament, tools, etc.). (1:10 AM)

jokes on me, turns out i actually need to make an image to submit for the devlog or something. ok, imma sketch this on paper since i cannot draw straight lines on the drawing tablet for some reason (im working on it ok)

ok, 1:31 AM and that's it for day 1! basically, setting things up and setting the plan! ok, good night!
