# 2/4/2026 - 36th Update!

welcome back, its 1:20 AM on 2/5/2026, i have till 2 AM for today! spent like two hours today filling out a form. ok, so we need to do the z axis today, i have ap language hw reading playing in the background, lets go!

what is going on outside??? so as i was saying, im not exactly sure how to calculate how many teeth we need for this belt, since the featurescripts i have for belts only works for two points. anyways, no matter what happens, we'll probably just use a tensioning thing just to help with the length if its some weird number.

the search for a heatbed begins

bunch more searching, this might be the one, back to infill, yeah, idk. hmm is it? unfortunately, not many review here so thats sus

something funny, theres [this](https://www.amazon.com/XVBILM-Printer-Leveling-Components-Heating/dp/B0GDQNN5YZ/) set of leveling spring things that says $11.22/5 = $1122.00. yeah idk whats going on here, but looking for cheap m3 spring screws.

since its getting late, imma wrap it up here with what we need to do:
- model the heights (i already got the sheet and the sus heater)
- model the spring heights and lift setup (probably PLA for the base, worried it might warp though, gonna look into it)
- get the mounting points to the side, probably connected to the PLA base thing
- rotation for pulley stuff, also tensioner
- add holding bits for the ends (not sure how we'd incorporate the t nuts also going in there, unless we have different heights? but that also does restrict the upper bounds)

note that it probably doesnt matter how low it can go, now that i think about it, its more important to consider if it can reach the top (since, thats where the first layer is). also, i dont think im gonna really be printing anything that tall often, but we'll keep it for now.

ok, that's it for tonight! 2:10 AM, i have winter college night tomorrow, planning to finish homework in school (no robotics tomorrow, i think?) so that i can maybe work on this for more than an hour per day? (wow, today wasnt really much was it? i mean, getting an idea of what the shape will be and parts needed is pretty important, so sure, decent productivity today) ok, good night!
