# 2/16/2026 - 38th Update!

3:00 PM and we're back! before starting z axis stuff again, its probably a good idea to make a schedule/plan for this week

- 2/16/2026: Z Axis
    - Finish work on the main Z axis setup
    - Start work on the bearing/rotational areas on the top and bottom
- 2/17/2026: Z Axis (Final Day)
    - Finish bearing/rotational areas of the Z axis
    - Fix any conflicts
    - Place into assembly
- 2/18/2026: Continue Tool Area
    - Alignment (tool base to tool) system work
    - Start work on docking (tool to dock) system work 
- ???: Docking system
    - Test printed docking latch mechanisms?
- 2/19/2026: Finish Tool Area
    - Finish the tool (extruder)
    - CFD on the part cooling if time allows, otherwise can do later
    - Check for collision
- 2/20/2026: Work on Docking Bay and Check Collisions
    - Do most of docking bay (realistically, not much)
    - Overall CAD Full Assembly (shouldnt be hard at all)
    - Overall CAD check for any impossible actions or major issues
- 2/21/2026-2/22/2026: Last Days for CAD
    - Check everything
- 2/22/2026-2/24/2026: Electronics and Firmware
    - Wiring check and making sure we are rated properly
    - Firmware review (klipper) and check that everything is compatible
    - Work on BOM if time allows
- 2/24/2026-2/27/2026: BOM and Ship
    - Finish adding everything to the BOM
    - Reduce BOM, remove some parts if needed
- 2/28/2026: Buffer day
    - Final check and ship, ok if pushed to tomorrow

(yes, i know campfire will be running at the end of the month, review will probably come back in a week or two max? take your time though)

basically, CAD done by the end of break, then checks electronics and bom by the end of next week with shipping saturday (yes ill have robotics that entire day, but ill see what i can do that evening)! in super simplification, finish by end of this month

should be enough time... (and of course, going ahead of schedule is the plan)

ok, 3:07 PM, time to do more z axis work! (also, did you know that my digestive system is not happy today?) oh yeah, this morning just remembered we need to add limit switches to this!

hmm it might actually be possible to just belt the entire thing, currently we have one belt going through all the main area (the z t screw stuff) and one belt from the motor to that, did some moving (because its kinda obvious that we cant shove everything sufficiently at the bottom) so much that we might be able to go over that just kidding that doesnt make sense (since the belt stuff is meant to be at the bottom, as low as possible, so that it doesnt conflict). i mean, two belts is still better than three to reach from source to destination, right?

modified the mastersketch side heights to include information about the side heights of the lift base thingy (we need a name for tihs)

seems like 19.3cm for the z axis linear rods is possible? (currently 18cm in cad)

mfw when the build setup is 18.456 diagonal but that number actually cuts out the corner of the support thingy

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202602/02162026 - 1.png>)

and there it is! t8 screws go over that (coincidentally the perfect height), the whole thing is 1 cm thick (should be more than enough), 3 screws per arm, has a top and bottom layer "sandwich" to it, clearances for printability and fit should be good?

4:39 PM, quick break to watch my robotics teams valentines day special episode oh boy

4:54 PM, back, that was funny, ok, added a couple more fillets to it, time to work on the vertical structure?

ok, so about the printing thing. idk how i found this doc, but [this](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3186eea6377bce7836e0401c/w/5553290dba011a4fef555910/e/45d615a5b9130724f59f9021) onshape cad seems to be a good example? basically, we need a silicon heater thingy with a metal plate on top of it. seems easy enough right? the truth is, just kidding, this aint a youtube video. or is it? just kidding.

anyways, back on track (geometry dash reference?) we need to find these parts somewhere. also, one more thing, since we have a glass panel on top for printing (i think? or would using a build plate be cheaper? idk), we need some mounting solution for it, be it magnetic or whatnot

reminder that we have a $81.86 left, with a $40.00 buffer (this is for unexpected taxes and such, keeping it for now, we could figure out the exact number at the end)

ok, this z axis looks good in cad and assembly (ish), so i guess its time to start working on the belting! also, no clue how we'd do the lower transfer axis thingy for the motor to big belt, im guessing we'll use whatever leftovers are from the 1.2cm linear rods and use that? (current numbers say 4.7cm, which is probably more than enough)

so im guessing the 2cm extrusion areas gonna be used for this? unless we incorporate some bottom thing that drops the center down, but again, its the top that gets priority here (since, if you can reach the bottom but not the extruder area, well, thats kinda useless)

also, not exactly sure how to drive the lead screw? yeah sure, pulley with the t8 screw line on the inside, lock up down rotation, spin it, but is that right? also, is there a clean way to do it? (or is it shaft collar? that would be funny) ok, thanks to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkOhH9OUMto) video for demonstrating the lead screw thing, yeah, its just some shaft collars that lock the rotation and then just rotating it to do it. alright.


5:40 PM, brb, back at 6:11 PM!

just had a fortune cookie and guess what it said

"Don't be afraid to admit when you need a break." - Fortune Cookie 2026

yeah mhm. yeah no i cant take another month break. also, last time i got advice from it i crashed the robot in a match after it said "you bring luck to everything you touch" or something like that so im not too sure about that

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202602/02162026 - 2.png>)

side quest, added the gusset stuff (should be all? not sure about the motor area)

did a bit of playing around with images and stuff and i think this looks pretty cool!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202602/02162026 - 3.png>)

(yes, obviously, we're not done yet, but that doesnt mean you cant think about the end outcome!)

ok, 6:43 PM, off to dinner!

so its 12:36 AM, not back for long

fun fact: i have every color needed to make shadow the hedgehog (well, i am running low on some, but still, its funny). oh and tails. and knuckles. (assuming peach can be replaced with yellow or white, idk, turn the saturation up)

anyways, z axis stuff! also, how am i gonna print the arms? yeah we need supports for that. or do we? i mean, its not priority, but we could just split it into pieces, depending on if we have like a good amount of screws left (flashback to `raven` with min maxing screw placements lol)

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202602/02162026 - 4.png>)

so thats the idea! whatever we do, we need some shaft collar (if its on the pulley itself, itll be ok, if its on the top and bottom, its also ok, point is, we need to not make the rotation from the pulley move the pulley up/down, it needs to be locked in height, then the rotation actually spins the lead screw)

probably should consider the heights of these things since it needs to be? well its gotta fit in 2 cm, so 3mm shaft collars probably wont work. hmm. i mean, the plates can be shaft collars but thats weird. maybe something with bearings? idk, gonna go to sleep now!

ok, 1:00 AM now, good night!
