# 2/3/2026 - 35th Update!

im back. once again. yeah i disappeared for a week. it's currently 1:31 AM on 2/4/2026, so we wont get much done now, but i did just want to journal my feelings for this project.

spark's technical challenge, at least to me, doesnt seem to have started yet. yes, researching how these motion systems work, practicing sourcing and all, that's pretty significant, but at the end of the day, structurally wise, spark's cad isn't that hard. yes, theres tolerances and it may be one of the document with the most features, but it doesnt really feel "fulfilling" to me. at least not yet. it feels oddly, simple, you know? yeah, sure, i havent actually constructed it, but i do kinda miss the joy of learning something really wild or trying something actually challenging. 

the real challenge of spark is the amount of work that needs to be done. its not that much to model, if you're thinking top down, but each feature takes so much time (not thinking time, i mean onshape takes forever when you have 100+ features) and effort to make, so that adds up. additionally, ive been really locked out or not feeling like myself this entire project. yes, that's 3-4 months of feeling in a "creative depression" where time just moves by too quickly. i dont know. looking back, i cant believe its been three and a half weeks since kickoff, which really didnt feel like it. i dont know, i think the worlds moving too fast and all this college and future "decide your life" stuff is just energy consuming. even though im not actively working on that all the time, i think all the school stuff day in and day out is just exhausting and leaves me with minimal energy to start homework which goes till past midnight with robotics.

in summary, i think spark's real challenge so far is endurance and trying to get out of this pit ive somehow fallen into. i dont know why i feel like im in this pit. maybe its the lack of seeing something new? i do have plans for a project after this one with blueprint, but that is mostly PCB focused, so i wonder how that would flow (subtle puns). but of course, since we already have 34 logs of work before this, at least on this repository, i cant exactly drop all this work. call it sunk time fallacy or whatever, but i think this project can be pulled to the end if i put in enough effort to finish up all the little bits and bobs that need working. the only problem is motivation after exhaustion and actually finding time to do this. and speaking of having time, its funny that the single day i dont have robotics on a weekday is taken up by college night starting at 7 PM this week. thanks for deciding not to choose a perfectly fine zoom meeting lol (id attend, but seriously, going to bronx science at 7PM to probably around 9PM is super inconvieniet. then id be tired on friday, do robotics saturday, come back after a 1.5 hour train commute tired, then spend sundays realizing its already sunday, then its monday, etc.)

so what is this at the end of the day? as the title suggests and as i mentioned in the very first log, spark was about trying to find a spark again to get myself motivated again. and i think its instead turned into this month long fight to keep working on it.

but hey, its february, and you this year its in a pretty neat shape. so here's the dealo. im gonna try, to the best i can, work on something a day. now, these updates will likely be incredibly short, but thats sorta the point, to get the ball rolling again!

anyways, a couple days ago, did some work fixing the fasten mates and fillets for the -x corner stacks! anyways, z axis work! reflecting on the design a bit, we really dont need pulleys at the end, its really just a bearing stack thing ("fake bearings" would probably do here), also, not sure what belt we'll necessarily use for this, worst comes to worst, we could just add some sketchy tensioning system (should probably model this right)

also, one side of the fake bearings might actually need teeth now that i think about it, ok, so i just realized the original idea was to use multiple belts instead of one continous one, but i guess it shouldnt really matter here? hold up we need to conider the different z heights oops

ok, its 2:20 AM, but thats just two continous belts, gonna see if they make 2gt belts like that, but yeah, good night for now!
