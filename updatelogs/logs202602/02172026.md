# 2/17/2026 - 39th Update!

ok 5:15 PM in NYC, did you know that the reason why my java tests for frc code stuffs wasnt working? yeah it was the extension, turns out v0.44 doesnt work so i downgraded to v0.43. strange. (to be clear, running test with gradle works, just the sidebar wasnt picking up on any tests present in the repository, or at least reporting it in the sidebar, running it in the terminal works fine)

anyways, goal today is to finish z axis stuff, then post a journal update tomorrow to sum up all this!

time for side heights, again

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202602/02172026 - 1.png>)

should be decent side heights, just changed the heights so that it fits (the far left one was at 5.15cm, changed to 4.7, now all rod numbers are perfectly used!)

also, reminder that we need to add motor controllers to the BOM, since im pretty sure the SKR 1.4 turbo doesnt have it built in? also, for the "fake bearings", im thinking of just putting them in their own part studio or writing a featurescript for it, just for performance? anyways, time to work on the bottom bit!

playing around with ideas right now and had a very silly one, what if we do a "solid state bearing" for the bottom? basically a bearing but the bearing part is both vertical and horizontal, for support in both directions? the idea is basically just a bearing but it needs two to pair. in theory, this would remove the need to have shaft collars (since, PLA ones that small are probably garbage (the one used on `raven` is MASSIVE (5.5cm in diameter, uses 2 M4 4cm screws iirc))). the goal is also the use the support bracket things on the top and bottom as the shaft collar to force the spin! (we would need the pulley to lock onto the lead screw still though, so we might still need some metal pulley)

measurements so far: 139.630cm length (139.630cm from one measurement, 139.159cm by volume, idk, roughly 140cm) for the upper belt, so probably 1 meter of belt is more than enough?

and also [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832631013486.html) has some pulleys! also, might replace the one we found back in 12/26/2025 because that is 2GT, not sure of the difference. also, this would not work since we need shaft collars for the vertical coreXY transmission. theres also [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832631013486.html)

ok seems like 2gt and gt2 are the same thing (for pitch, which kinda is the only thing that matters here, maybe shape), only differing in material sometimes?

current issue is the fact that its not exactly made for a 1.2cm inner shaft. so heres the plan

- lead screws
    - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808347934917.html) bore 8mm, 20T W6
        - check [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256809944105936.html) also
    - uses the T8 screws as axle
- belt redirecting
    - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832631013486.html) 16T W6 B5, no T and GT2
    - use 3d printed rod or some bought thing for axle (3d printed rod is probably enough for this since its not that much load, just minimize the distance) (theres also bearings too so its also ok)
- middle linear rod
    - 3d printed or no pulley there, doesnt really matter too bad if no pulley, but a 3d printed one should work fine here, needs teeth if yes
- motor to belts
    - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808347934917.html) bore 12mm, 30T W6
        - check [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256809944105936.html) also
    - uses linear rod as axle

![huh](</updatelogs/images/202602/02172026 - 2.png>)

what a deal! just kidding, its just out of stock. or cant be sold here. idk, just cant buy it. 

yo why are all these scams, thats crazy expensive

guess whats crazy? for once im actually working on the BOM at the same time! great for money stuff, not so great speed

30t w6 b12

ok its 7:14 PM and im quite late for dinner, brb

ok 10:04 PM and back! did a bit of drawing and gotta say, something about this pencil is boosting my abilities somehow. its also a cool pencil (thanks matthew for it as the secret santa!) in fact, here you go, it's the "Pacific Arc DP1005" (silver color), its pretty cool, anyways, back to BOM work!

ok, it seems that the amazon stuff is a total of $145.30 (base of $126.45, idk why theres shipping costs when i was told free shipping over $35 but i guess it goes to handling)

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202602/02172026 - 3.png>)

hopefully my address isn't in there...

anyways, updating the main sheet, with safety buffer changed to $30 from $40 (since thats just majority taxes), we have $42.72 left, which is pretty good, given we did most of the motion BOM today? theres still bearings but lemme just finish that and then talk about it (also, 2020 nuts and screws and stuff too)

also found [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808692439691.html) belts, theres probably no cheap way to get a long belt so stitching together or melting a longer gt2 belt might work? maybe? also we need some idlers for the upper belts...

ok 10:38 PM gonna go watch a movie

ok, 12:23 AM and back! bearing time... ok dont use the BOM thing in onshape to name stuff, crazy lag...

so we kinda need 24 bearings. possibly more because we dont have idlers yet (probably 30 total then, 2 sets for the 2 coreXY belts, 1 set for the Z belt, technically needs two but whatever)

these bearings are expensive wow

would it be smarter to replace the z axis with two motors? since just found [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802068491329.html) which is like an extra dollar but with an additional motor, it does change it from 59Ncm to 42Ncm (note that the extruder motor is currently 17Ncm), but thats still enough right? i mean, a bit slower maybe, but jamming? idk. it would, however, save on all the expenses that are coming with belting the z axis? (roughly $15 if im calculating it right) (am i doing this all for $15? yes.)

ok i guess we're recadding this tomorrow, this change does sacrifice on build height (unless we flip the motors upside down and belt it, but that kinda defeats the purpose but still)

idk, gonna sleep on it and think about it. obviously, this makes us behind schedule. hmm.

ok, 12:58 AM, good night!
