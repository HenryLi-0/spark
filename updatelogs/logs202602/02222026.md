# 2/22/2026 - 40th Update!

ok, so, as you could probably tell, ive disappeared for like a couple days (oh its been 4 days...)

this break hasnt been too productive for spark in progress, compared to last time. unforutunate, what can we do better? idk, its just motivation and getting the ball rolling. however, in today's very epic snowfall and the resulting snow day tomorrow, along with the kids on the street laughing and playing in snow, im feeling in a good mood. makes me happy to see that people still play outside in the snow, which is super cool since nyc is currently in a vechile "ban" of sorts while this blizzard goes until tomorrow-ish?

anyways, now that i want to write a giant comic about stuff, lets get back to spark! currently 11:13 PM, and we let the idea sit for a bit. what's the update? (yes, ive thought about it here and there)

so, the dilemma was that we either kept the 4 motor setup (x3 59 Ncm for XYZ, x1 17 Ncm for extrusion) or switched to a 5 motor setup (x5 42 Ncm). both being the same price basically, with the sacrifice of speed/force (technically rotational force but whatever) for price (no need for belting), its kinda a hard choice. however, here's the thought process for the 5 motor setup:

- 2 Z motors (obviously)
- frame is still the same size, with the z motors in the electornics/printing area with a belt that runs across so that it can connect
- however, this still relies on having a belt and two shaft collars per z axis, which is probably similarly priced
- instead, we could have the motors directly shaft collared to the lead screws
- that way, we save on the belt price and the space!

however, this result does leave us with the fact that the motor would be in the ground. how do you fix that? you just lift the entire thing off the ground with giant 3d printed corner stands! what are you gonna do with all that space on the bottom? honestly, idk. maybe a drawer or something?

now, this is gonna take some work to implement, and this whole change does have additional questions on it

- is syncing the z motors going to be an issue?
    - possibly, not likely but also not impossible, probably best to just belt it with leftover gt2 from the coreXY stuff, through in a tensioning 3d printed bit
- what is a anti backlash nut
    - idk, doesnt seem overly necessary if its accurate enough?
- does the SKR 1.4 turbo have enough space for this? (check)
    - yes it does! (perfectly 5, in fact)
- what would our budgeting look like then? (probably less)
    - probably less
    - more seriously, maybe $7 cheaper ish
- does the raised mass present a problem?
    - uh
    - maybe
    - possibly
    - potentially (potential energy get it)
    - idk, obviously yes, probably adding a drawer or what not at the base and throwing in a textbook would keep it stable
- does the decreased motor force also present a problem?
    - uh didnt do math, probably just lower acceleration, but again, main feature is tool changing, not world record benchy prints
    - oh some kids outside are pelting each other with snowballs
    - the whole inertia thing probably isnt too bad, since theyre stepper motors (yes, not a valid reason, but still) and there shouldnt be too much resistance or mass to move (ngl we were in the middle of the rotation unit in physics before break and kinda forget a bit of stuff, so dont expect correct math here)

wait hold up, with z motors, you could TECHNICALLY mod it to have an extra dof (if you have rotational bits and not sync up the lead screws, you could pan the roll of the build plate, just saying) (this is NOT a priority lol)

also its called a coupler oops (i mean, shaft collar coupling is a thing, right?) (coupler is more generic ig)

bom spree

- [t nut slot things](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807638725964.html)
- aluminum extrusions still seem cheaper on amazon
- [screws](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804341271555.html) (thanks `raven`!)

ok so what do we need to change?

- remove some z sketches
- update heights in order to have lower space
- add corner stands to frame subsystem
- update for space for the z motors
- update BOM and stuff

ok, its 12:16 AM, do you think i could do this today? hmm...

ALSO, important news, well, not really, but i am thinking of the reveal audio for this. idk, went through like 3 changes, not sure which ones the best for this?

hold up did onshape make an update whys the number box so weird looking

current bom is $354.06 ($30 safety buffer)

yo whys onshape lagging

so i have to do this corner thing again. ok.

just heard an officer car say "get off the road" at 1:26 AM idk why i found this funny lol

oh its just poor connection. huh. anyways

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202602/02222026 - 1.png>)

stands done and added to the assembly, screw holes and all, also changed the hole size to be M3 for all of them, thanks to the variable!

so we should be good for the stands? i guess z changes some time soon (hopefully tomorrow but who knows), 1:57 AM now, today was pretty ok, oh wow the street is covered in lots of snow, we need to work on a journal update sometime soon, ok, good night!
