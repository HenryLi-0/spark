# 2/15/2026 - 37th Update!

well, no promises, right?

day 2 of mid winter break, the snow from like, more than half a month ago is still outside. i will have to say this here again, spark isn't a hard project, at least in my eyes. it is challengingly complex to design around, but not necessarily hard to do. however, this is one of my hardest projects id say because of the mental strength it takes to get back into this. like, its not the easiest to do, right? part of me is also feeling like im making excuses for myself, which, i guess this kind of is.

but today i was getting my hair cut and realized that its smarter to pocket at the end to save regen time. like, you dont need to recalculated that until the end (additionally, it should also make it so that changes dont cause "ripples" to break further stuff if all the featurescript based pocketing is at the end)

so 10:08 PM, got like half an hour, then hopefully continue tomorrow if i can get myself to wake up earlier? goals today are simply to move all the pocketing stuff in the tool to the end, then maybe some z axis work.

also, updates on nine circles, beated it on 2/8/2026 ~2 AM, also beat jawbreaker 2/14/2026 ~2 AM, so thats fun! gonna move on to ichor (yes, i know, theres two, i started practicing the wrong one but whatever) by codex (i think?) to hopefully bring more skill (since i dont want to be wave carried lol)

never mind its 10:15 PM, gotta go

ok, back at 12:33 AM, gonna do like half an hour

much better now! went from 8.71s to 3.55s regen time! you know what, i guess ill just jump straight into the z axis, we can make a mess first, perfect it later

quick pause, this is quite the sus belt routing. i mean, i guess its better for less backlash?

you know its kinda funny my pointer finger on my right hands rotation bit (lower than the knuckles, sonic reference?) kinda hurts today, mightve done a bit too much geometry dash

so lemme talk about my idea for the base of the thing. as in, the setup that keeps everything up. since the whole thing has a distance (measuring from the centers of the opposite side linear rods) of 22cm, and my 3d printer only does 18.5cm (well, not "only", but you get the point). now, i could get a print on the school/robotics 3d printers (they are x1c iirc), but making one giant piece is probably a bad idea, since id need to reprint it every time it breaks (however, we do have carbon fiber filament, which is probably good for strength, maybe heat resistance). now, we obviously cant buy this custom size, so its probably best to design around this and have multiple parts!

i guess we're doing a sandwich stack style thing? 

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202602/02152026 - 1.png>)

i have the layout ready, just need to figure out how to stack this. good new, the entire middle part isnt as big as what i thought it was! because a 15cm x 15cm setup does, infact, fit inside a 18.5cm x 18.5cm build plate. so the setup would look something like a 15x15cm thing on the bottom, 4 arms sticking out with alignment stuff near the sandwich, and the ending layer being another 15x15cm thing? seems pretty strong. also, hopefully the suspension springs or whatever on the ends are able to act like the outside screws? probably?

ok, 1:11 AM, its snowing outside, hopefully gonna try to wake up earlier tomorrow? wow i need to catch up on the logs...

ok, good night!
