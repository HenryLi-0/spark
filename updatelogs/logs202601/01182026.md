# 1/18/2026 - 30th Update!

im back. again?

so, i disappeared for half a month. again. again. need we with needless reintroductions? probably not, you know the dealo, two solid weeks of school with kickoff (yay) and thats pretty time and energy consuming (we do have decnet amount of time, but just getting that energy back is so slowwwww). anyways, here i am at 2:00 AM of 1/16/2026, i will be back tomorrow, friday night, to work on this! essentially, the only stuff we have left is the latching mechanisms, the z axis stuff, the mounting stuff, and thats it for cad (assuming we arent forgetting anything), then some BOM and optimization last! so im gonna just refamiliarize myself with what we have tonight, do a sleep and school day, then come back tomorrow! (yes, after robotics lol) right, midyears is next week, so more time to work on this!

anyways, nine circles update, havent played in a bit, but we're at 71% or 72% now, and have completed 39%-100% in a copy twice already, so we should be almost there! started jawbreaker too, seems harder imo

some notes from tonight:
- front collision check isnt always correct on the -x side since we have to account for the x slider base size
- x slider base has been changed from 5cm to 4.5cm!
- had this idea a couple days ago but what if we use rubber bands instead of springs?
- fixed a thing with the fans for illustrative purposes extruding the fan mounting areas too
- added some fillets to the wind tunnel so that the sus alignment aligns at least a bit better

but yeah, that's it for now, currently 2:45 AM, here's a good night and see you tomorrow night!

ok, so its actually not 1/16/2026 or 1/17/2026, but actually 1/18/2026, so yeah, we're finally back! currently 4:15 PM and i just finished doing a bunch of stuff, so HERE WE GOOOOOOO (was gonna work on this last night but fell asleep early oops)

first things first, blueprint site... mfw i upload a photo and it deletes all the text. ok, back! so, im gonna do a pivot of work today, since i dont want to just back into the insane work and loading times that is the tool base. so, for now, we'll start a bit soft and just do the z axis stuff

z axis stuff:
- heat bed (and sourcing)
- whatever plate/surface on that heat bed (glass or something?)
- homing sequence
- synchronizing the lead screws and connecting to motor
- wire management

and one more thing, no, putting pla on the outside is likely a bad idea, since, we'll its gonna 100% deform. ok, so lead screws

[this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807271104483.html) seems good, but lets talk pricing. no, not the "deal" price. 

- 200mm $3.75
- 250mm $5.04
- 300mm $5.23

sure, being non linear is probably expected, but why is it not quadratic or something? why is the increase from 200 to 250 more than 250 to 300? anyways, point is, we have a choice to either go with 200mm in height of z or doing 250mm where we might as well do $0.19 per each (so +$1) for an extra 5cm. HOWEVER, does this work out with the aluminum extrusions?

fun fact, we actually can! wrote [a little script](</CAD/scripts/extrusions.py>) to (hopefully) find the most optimized setup, now, im not sure if it is the most optimal solution, but hey, all i need to know is if its possible, if we can do it, thats all thats needed! so yeah, we can! also, this script matches the spreadsheet pretty well (as in, you can just paste it in, format it a bit together, and it goes write in!)

wow, first code in here...

so, do we go for 250mm? i guess so. but then might as well do 300mm

ok, so ive been doing a bunch of debating over the z axis setup

possible setups:
- 4 screws
    - current setup, scared that the motor may not have enough power to move all of them
    - potentially expensive
- 2 screws (horizontal/diagonal)
    - cheaper, but scared that excessive weight on one side will cause leaning (also, if one screw is misaligned, yeah)
- 2 screws (diagonal), 2 rods
    - might be cheaper than 4 screws, benefit is that the motor has less rods to fight against
    - belt can still go around everything

looking at other possible ways to do this, found a chain and rod based design (sure, works, but im NOT gonna deal with chains lol)

hmm it seems that a triple lead screw and triple lienar rod setup is faily used often? now, not sure if a single motor can drive all of this (worst comes to worst, just add a gearbox, slower, but its fine), but yeah, that should do? the triple lead screw setup is for control while the rods are for support/alignment, im assuming here.

ok, 6:04 PM, gonna go eat dinner now!

ok, 12:21 AM now, let's at least finish this today. also, the thing with linear rod sourcing, we can probably also use the script for that, so that's neat! ok, so my researching seems like the triple setup is good? so from what im getting, the linear rods keep the plane defined and the lead screws do the lifting, but somehow doesnt jam because its soft? not exactly sure about that, im gonna take a visit to that one event, yep, infill!

ok, so from what im getting, we should probably do:
- one motor for one lead screw and two linear rods
- two motors for two lead screws and four linear rods

in order to save budget and not suffer with BOM later, let me find linear rods first

small issue. so. i was measuring in centimeters. not millimeters. these linear rods are gonna cost $200. at least on aliexpress! seems like amazons better for metal extrusion stuff than aliexpress

- ~$40 for x4 12mm 500mm [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/12mm-350mm-13-78-inches-Vigorous-Hardened/dp/B0C2MHFMM8/) (you need to do x2 twice)
- ~$14 for x2 12mm 350mm [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/12mm-350mm-13-78-inches-Vigorous-Hardened/dp/B0BZQ8X3PG/)

HOLD UP. this is not the optimal solution here. we have to min max this.

- 13/200  = 0.065
- 16/250  = 0.064
- 13/300  = 0.043
- 14/350  = 0.040
- 17/400  = 0.043
- 20/500  = 0.040
- 22/600  = 0.037
- 30/1000 = 0.030

therefore, it's somehow better to order larger! gonna modify the extrusion script to be a function...

after that, we get this!

```
to cut: [46, 46, 46, 46, 32.6, 32.6, 13.6, 13.6, 35, 35]

rod 1 (leftover 8): [46, 46]
rod 2 (leftover 8): [46, 46]
rod 3 (leftover 2.799999999999999): [35, 35, 13.6, 13.6]
rod 4 (leftover 34.800000000000004): [32.6, 32.6]
```

therefore, we'll need x4 1000mm rods, totalling to $60 being the (possible) best solution? also, it seems that just being one 1000mm rod is the same price as two, plus a dollar. so idk how that works, but sure! i guess the cardboard box is the expensive bit then? so the box is $27 and each rod is $1? i guess that works out somehow? anyways, enough questioning that, get questioning how worried you are for the BOM

price increase alert! unless i found the wrong one, the aluminum extrusions have gone up $6

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202601/01182025 - 1.png>)

so. so. so. we might need to do optimizing later. probably gonna remove the top extrusions for just nothing or maybe a giant plate? im not even sure what we're missing from the BOM right now, pretty sure everything in the cad already (minus the belt and bearings) is in there? oh right. the build plate.

so the one from 11/8/2025 is $22. yeah. so we're going over budget here, most definitely. yeah, today just became a BOM day, didn't it?

so, we're gonna have to pause everything so we can sort this out, because this has huge changes for the rest of the project. im thinking removing the top extrusions and the lower set of X linear rods? that might compromise a bit on strength (top might be more wobbly), but actually, its probably one or the other that needs to go. theres also the option of scaling down.

is scaling down the move here? idk. what i do know is that its 2:08 AM and im headed off to bed. yep, cliffhanger! see you tomorrow lol, ok, good night!
