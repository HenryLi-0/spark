# 1/20/2026 - 32nd Update!

10:51 PM today. we have to make a decision today or else we obviously wont finish in time.

here's the dealo. ive been thinking about this for probably an hour outside of this time, pacing back and forth, so here's the plan.

- we're NOT gonna sacrifice on the extruder setup, since the machine, at the least, should be able to multi color print (and two color does not justify this setup)
- we're gonna KEEP coreXY, since it's essential to the structure at this point
- we're gonna KEEP the basic architecture, since that WORKS structurally

however, there will be changes

- we're gonna SHRINK the build plate from 235mm to 150mm-180mm. why? this will remove the aluminum extrusion requirements. additionally, it may allow us to use smaller linear rods (will need to look into this). this should skim at least $10-$25
- we're gonna HEAVILY optimize the BOM, for the cheapest but still usable things we can get
- we're gonna increase the budget to $450 if needed after this, but that is to be decided after changes ($50 will go to screws and etc.)

and that's my plan for keeping this under budget. not sure if it'll completely help, but we have to try/start somewhere, right?

here's the BOM as of now, just so we can compare

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202601/01202026 - 1.png>)

and now its optimizing time.

so turns out the cad isnt exactly the happiest when you do this, but the mastersketch issues seems to be good now? went through all the checks, seems good. theres only space for 3 tools now, so thats that. also, note, of course you can switch them out and covert this into a blot at any time. that brings me to another point, found something interesting for the latch mechanism! since springs are, well, kinda goofy and potentially expensive, there is soemthing that relies on the material flexibility, [here's](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQyaWOyDZi-/) the instagram post i found it from! so, obviously, this will probably weaken over many runs, but it is fairly simplier, and doesnt require much form the design (additionally, the "prongs" can stick out, so thats another plus)

anyway, back to the cad to make sure everything didnt explode..., need to talk about linear rods in a bit

ok, bunch of fixes later involving the motor mount for the coreXY, time to talk about linear rods! well, not much to say, we can probably shrink them from 1.2cm to 1.0cm or 0.8mm.

you know, its a bit weird seeing spark so small, it almost feels kinda sad and puny. anyways, point is, big and dominating doesnt work out if its not possible. anyways, this is the part where i change the linear rod size to 1.0cm!

shockingly, everything still works! ok, its 12:47 AM now and im being told to go to sleep, we'll assemble the BOM tomorrow, hopefully things are cheaper then? hold up, the tool stuff exploded, one second... ok, fixed, weird pocketing issues, ok, 1:01 AM, good night!
