# 1/1/2026 - 29th Update!

ok, 3:26 PM (yes, i got up at 1:00 PM today, yeah, great start to the year. however, i did do some homework which is good)

anyways, after playing around with hackatime, i think the time count from yesterday includes both the cad and vscode time (which makes sense), wait im gonna use the bathroom real quick and just update the start time to when i come back! ok, originally was 3:04 PM, now it's 3:27 PM, had to submit a couple things, but yeah, here we go! first off, yesterday's log... ok, 3:41 PM and done with that!

anyways, what's on the todo?
- finish up alignment stuff (if any)
- start work on latches
- tedious spacer and axle stuff
- "fake bearings"

ok fixed weird internet disconnect issues! you know, i think we should probably work on the latches in a different part studio, we already have been avoiding the space well, and we are getting WAY too many features in one part studio... also for the spacers too...

also where are we placing these magnets? we also need to lock down the belts in there... ok, so it seems like, for the belts, we could just have clips that stick outside and wrap through a hole inside the side of the extruder. seems alright. hmm it would be smart to use the screw as things to grab on to, but im not sure we have enough space for that? (as in, the screws are too short and only meant to keep the stepper motor attached) i don't really like the idea of the belts grabbing onto the pla (note to self that we should update the side fan mounts since they are currently very not printer friendly)

ok, so i want to print the base with the layers being on the XZ plane (so the bearing hole will be pointing upwards), since that makes the most sense with the forces being on the sides? or no, since that also doesn't make sense, both in print quality (theres a big gaping hole in the center) and we don't want it to be ripped apart by the coreXY belts? well we also have bits keeping it together, since we have the motor, printing it on the XY or YZ is also kinda wonky since, well, the bearing hole itself might rip the whole thing apart. nevertheless, we will always have to find some other method to secure the fan mounts, since even in YZ, printing the fan mounts in YZ will be weak sideways (one smack might just break that whole part, meaning that reprtining everything would be a crazy waste of material)

so, probably some side screws that also provide an area for the filament to grab onto, huh? yeah, i agree

oh yeah, one more thing i wanted to do today, check parametric... yeah that made everything explode. am i in the mood of fixing something that inevitably doesnt really matter at the end of the day? not really. this also isnt that high priority, so we could wait for now.

so more stuff on the todo list

- finish up alignment stuff (if any)
- brackets
- fan setup and belt clip areas
- start work on latches
- tedious spacer and axle stuff
- "fake bearings"

ok, we might have screws that stick out the side of the tool head. doesn't seem avoidable at this point.

why are there so many internet disconnects

a bit more work and that's good! also added a couple chamfers to the bearing holes

issue now is how to mount the top alignment thing... fixed some vanity stuff, working on brackets now

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202601/01012026 - 1.png>)

thats a new one...

ok 5:45 PM and gonna help a family member with setting up a phone... ok, back at 6:00 PM! spontatnoues license update (GNU doesnt really work here since we barely have any code anyways)

so much for "just" a price for internet, why do i keep getting disconnects on "reliable" internet, gonna try to fix it now

ok, back at 11:55 PM after multiple side quests

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202601/01012026 - 2.png>)

so yeah! that's the progress for today. not too much, just the fan stuff, some belt wrapping research thing, and the front brackets! just gonna update the top back plate real quick since i realized that we can actually put a bracket there... ok, some mastersketch edits for the latch since that screw location is impossible...

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202601/01012026 - 3.png>)

so yeah, fixed that spacing a bit, so the latch stuff will go in the space between the tool conneciton back screw connection and gearbox top back plate, along with the space between the gearbox top front plate and the front shell!

ok, it's 12:35 AM, gonna end today early! ok, good night!
