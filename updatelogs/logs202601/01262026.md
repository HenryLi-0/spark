# 1/26/2026 - 34th Update!

welcome back! ok, 5:00 PM today, shouldve started earlier but whatever. so, instead of compacting all my ap language video watching hw i need to get done by next week, im gonna start today, with also music in the background. idk how effective triple tasking is, but lets see (triple tasking sounds cool, i mean multitasking with three things)

ok, the overstimulation is crazy, so here we go! first things first, journal time, for 1/18/2026, 1/19/2026, 1/20/2026, and 1/25/2026

hold up did ap classroom just say thinking space ii

also, we need to add

- magnets
- something i forgot

to the BOM

ok, i guess we aint solo cading a robot today, back from writing the logs! ok, so now that we're through the bom saving stuff (probably foreshadowing? hopefully not) (we're probably gonna have to do more optimization later)

so what now.

referencing the log back on 12/25/2025, which was wow a month ago, we still need to work on

- tool base, tool area, docking bay, collision checks
- electronics, firmware research
- z axis work
- bom optimization and work

oh right, just remembered, we need to add stepper motor drivers/controlelrs to the BOM. and linear bearings

ok, i think today's z axis work. ok, so usually, we'd use a triple screw and linear rod setup. unforunately here, we actually only have two linear rods from the BOM, just looked into changing the motor linear rod lengths, doesnt seem to be enough to get a third linear rod for the z axis.

not sure what i thinks good. also not sure if a single motor can drive the entire z axis. looked through a bunch of voron designs, some projects on google, not sure what to get form this. something something anti backlash nuts

ok, so from what i can tell, this is a possible setup. imagine the build plate as a square, not rotated, just a square, 150mm by 150mm. then, we have a T8 lead screw on the top and lower side, with linear rods on the left and right sides. that's my current idea for a top down view, with the xyz of the CAD, then we have some belts that run from from the motor to the right linear rod, which spins a setup of belts that transfer this motion to the T8 lead screws somehow, from the single z motor. (it can also go past it, but point is, driven from a single motor for the z axis, probably some reduction there somewhere)

cad time

oh i see a possible source of some of yesterdays problems, the lower one is 1.3cm instead of 1.2cm, fixed now, heights also fixed

not sure if im really happy with this setup

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202601/01262026 - 1.png>)

ok, so if we do this setup, we're definitely doing belts. not sure how i feel about those corner bits, since that means we have to have some printed stands, probably could add some tensioning setup there, but i also want the z axis to have the max width it can have

pretty big silly issue, but the z axis cant actually reach the max height right now, gonna have to make the linear rods and screws a bit longer for this since the problem now is that we actually have to make it reach the max height, which it cant right now, ok fixed, 0.6cm is surely enough to have some setup to stop it from falling right

ok, 7:00 PM, off to dinner!

back at 11:34 PM! ok, so it seems like that on 11/15/2025 and 1/18/2026 i found the same lead screw page on aliexpress, so we're gonna be using 200mm of [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807271104483.html) lead screws! so this actually doesnt let me model 2mm external thread on low detail so i guess its gotta be clear high quality then...

ok sent in a ticket or something, idk, does this go in support?

ok, 12:05 AM, that took longer than expected, lead screw and nut modeled!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202601/01262026 - 2.png>)

so yeah, the next few days will probably be z axis work, then after that, finishing up the tool head, then working on docking! then electronics and stuff, and BOM, and stuff! ok, that's it for me tonight, it's 12:07 AM, oh yeah, forgot to say, it snowed a bunch yesterday! ok, good night!
