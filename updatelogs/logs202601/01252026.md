# 1/25/2026 - 33rd Update!

11:22 PM and we gonna do a fast work dash work today, not much time. anyways, had some thoughts about the top bit in the bathroom while brushing my teeth, that part should probably be attached with some screw so that its not one giant piece. anyways, point is, back to work!

stuff to do today:
- update BOM
- work on screw for the top alignment
- add magnet holes???

update bom time

extrusions went from 622cm to 514.8cm! ok, so onshape did a silly or something and didnt recompute the coreXY stuff in the part studio, so thats been forced and fixed now, linear rods went from 346.4cm to 276.8cm. just a note, if we have only 2 x linear rods, it goes to 200cm. just a note. 1.2cm rods seem cheaper than 1.0cm rods for some reason

updated rod lengths, extrusions now 514cm, fixed some BOM miscount (we were counting two motor support extrusions, theres only one now), 488cm now. coincidentally, perfect for 4*1220cm for the amazon thing, gonna see if this is solvable

uh oh not possible. by decreasing our height from 21cm to 18cm, its possible! this has cut a nice $25 off the BOM. neato! one downside is that we have to use silver extrusions instead of the black ones, which is kinda sad, but saves $4. maybe if theres somehow extra money at the end, who knows.

ok, now for the hard decision. do we get rid of the lower x linear rods? it would cut a nice $30 off the BOM, which is very luring. however, im not sure if we're structurally able to do this? also, the word i was looking for was tempting but i guess luring also works. ok, so now im actually not gonna be calculating stuff, but instead sim the x rods with the stuff

ALSO, JUST REMEMBERED THIS, BLUEPRINT HAS BEEN ONCE AGAIN EXTENDED TO MARCH! i will, similarly to last time, try to lock in so we dont once again slack off and not work on this for weeks.

updated the mastersketch to add some more tests for the collisions, working on the sim stuff! currently, since onshape is assuming full PLA printed stuff (which it wont, itll probably be 15%-25% infill for the x sliders), and the y linear rod is roughly 1.718 pounds. obviously, bearings contribute a bit, and theres no extruder yet, so id say a reasonable actual weight would be 2.5 pounds, but im gonna use 3 in the sim, just in case. of course, we're gonna test canitliver once again, since worst case testing. oh right, we are testing if we have 2 rods, so im gonna put 1.5 pounds of force on a weight for this test

alright, results in! 0.05cm! pretty neat. that's 0.5mm with it cantiliver! with more realistic numbers we get around 0.02cm. when turning off load region (this makes the load not specific to that cantiliver side, not sure exactly what this means), the far end drops by only 0.008cm! that's 0.08mm! middle is 0.002cm or 0.02mm. 

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202601/01252026 - 1.png>)

(dont be fooled by the x linear slider, thats just for a surface that i could sim attachment to. looking back, itll probably make more sense to use the corner thing, but whatever, this doesnt affect the sim. also, that's with 0.625 pounds of load, with a load region not specified). point is, this is pretty good! therefore, it should be safe to remove the lower set of x rods?

you know, this mastersketch is surprisingly robust to these changes? only one sketch was messed up from that (and it was just some positioning thing, should be fixed now!) and that was the tool base sketch (the main first one), so that's pretty cool! was gonna work on removing the lower x linear rod circles from the side, but i guess it makes sense to keep them because of the heights of the y ones (its alsos because removing them causes funny errors in two sketches and it creates the "sketch that claims it has unconstrained stuff when in reality its all constrained")

ok, coreXY is updated, working on frame now, note to future self, the corners of the corners pointing in the y direction on the -x of the printer might need to be removed if we rely on the fact that the print head can go outside of the frame. anyways, frame updated! time to update the BOM... ok, time to check if its possible, we're at 194.4cm total needed

uh oh not possible

ok, seem to have a fix, we just need the motor ones to be half a centimeter shorter, which is obviously doable! ok, we're at 193.4 cm now! (we do need to cad the "fake bearings" for the linear rods of the motors though, reminder)

ok, nice! so our BOM went from $373.14 with $26.86 left ($40 safety buffer, no extra funds from me), to $318.14 with $81.86 left ($40 safety buffer, no extra funds from me). nice! that's $55 shaved off today! we might actually have enough to finish this!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202601/01252026 - 2.png>)

stuff to add to bom:
- heat bed (150mm x 150mm)
- bearing stacks
- lead screws
- gt2 timing belt (need to get measurements)
- screws and nuts for structure
- any extra electronics for the setup (we might need some for the control and what not, pretty sure the printer motherboard doesnt do everything but not sure)
- wiring and outlet stuff

so yeah, that's it for me tonight! currently 1:30 AM, im guessing the next log has to summarize these last couple days of BOM fixing and stuff! ok, alright, good night!
