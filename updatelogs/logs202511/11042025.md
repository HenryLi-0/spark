# 11/4/2025 - 7th Update!

back! hopefully it hasnt been too long, but its 3:24 PM on a tuesday, since today's electron day or something (did i just type electron i meant electrion, i meant leection, i meant election) (i think i type electricity and electron too much that i automatically place the r there lol)

anyways, back to work, the music is on now, not some random study video. i should mostly be done with hw, just a bit of slide work and practicing and it should be good. anyways, to the cad! ok i got distracted its 3:35 PM now

today i learned that onshape has a frame feature

why am i so washed

i have cadded this one gusset 3 times at this point, i guess the lack of box tubing holes is really confusing me

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202511/11042025 - 1.png>)

yay, ok so its 5:04 PM now, and we have two gussets with pocketing. anyways, this could be 3d printed or milled, doesnt really matter too much? of course, we're gonna 3d print this, unless i can find some way to get so aluminum sheets and use the cnc mill (this probably wont happen).

anyways, enough ignoring the problem, lets head back to the master sketch and figure this out.

it probably would help getting actual dimensions of things we're working with, so quick detour!

found things on amazon, gonna check aliexpress though

    - options are either sketchy (not enough buyers) or just somehow more expensive?

gonna quickly cad the first one into onshape

so i was gonna add the threads but that added 240k+ triangles which was kinda funny

anyways, 

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202511/11042025 - 2.png>)

ok its 6:00 PM, ill be back in a bit!

ok, 6:26 PM, i think i know what to do now! only current concern is the fact that we *might* not be able to fully enclose this, with the current setup i have in mind. do i potentially sacrifice build space for an enclosure? anyways, suddent topic change, i wonder what pricing frm jlccnc is... since when did you have to request quotes for?

wait since when did jlc make linear rails what, [heres](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/B03/E-BMW/economical-linear-guide-mini-and-wide-standard-type-7-9-12-15) a link for future reference!

do my eyes decieve me? how is it possible [see here](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/T01/TXCJ/extruded-aluminum-t-slot-20-series(eu))

![huh](</updatelogs/images/202511/11042025 - 3.png>)

what the mass production is going on here

and what is a flex heater

anyways, its 6:51 PM now, off for dinner!

mfw its suddenly 11:34 PM

oh and then the linear rail is $22.76. well, it is still pretty good for a 300mm (30cm) linear rail! and we only need one anyways (product code `E-BMW7C-1-L300-ZF-C-M-E15`). do they sell linear rods?

why does the site use a google form for requests and why can i see their responses lol

[threaded rods](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/E09/EJLA/threaded-rods)

unforuntaetly, i dont think they sell linear rods? oh they call them linear shafts? wait a second this is also crazy cheap what? oh yeah, [here](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/B08/BACA/linear-shaft-solid-straight-g6-tolerance)! $4.72 for 30cm of rod with 25mm? 

ok, i guess we might replace the y axis with linear rail?

OH YEAH, one more update! since we're now cadding the thing rotated (the right side is the electronics part), we're gonna have to reverse the X and Y axises, so i guess we calling it coreYX? anyways, the rail that moves is the Y axis, where the tool moves forward and back, and the ends of this rail are on the X rails which run left and right.

been thinking about how to do the belting while not making it interfere with the stepper motors.

ok, so we have a top rail and bottom rail setup, and they connect to each layer at the points where the y axis touch the x?

[nice site](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Guides/How-to-Build-a-3D-Printer/Linear-Rod.html) (hi dr dflo again)

but question is once again, do i sacrifice build space for an enclosure?

eh no. i guess going for all that is quite a lot for a first printer, tool changing is already a lot. also, i just realized i need to fix something. ok, fixed it, the problem was that the frame didnt make sense for where the fialment was connected (the entire top needs to be open or else it just doesnt make sense, since filament would snap and what not)

ok, im gonna sketch my idea real quick, then head to bed! ok, 12:40 AM, here's the idea!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11042025 - 4.png>)

ok, that's it for today! oh yeah, here's a picture of the frame! (gussets arent added yet since idk how i want to add them)

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202511/11042025 - 5.png>)

also, back to the image before the last one about the idea for the rod positions, if budget allows it and aluminum extrusions really are that cheap, i might actually just go for an enclosure that goes around it, since if it is truly less than a dollar per giant extrusion, we could probably have an additional place for support on top! the only problem is that the filament will need to do very wonky activities to get there, but nothing a PTFE tube cant fix?

ok, good night!
