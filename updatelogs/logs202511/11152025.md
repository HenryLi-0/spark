# 11/15/2025 - 13th Update!

currently 11:55 AM here in NYC! gonna start in a bit, hold on a second...

ok, its 11:59 AM now, and let's get started! so i've been doing some thinking today, and then i remembered the youtube mechanism guy that has made way too many mechanisms, `thang010146`! i have no idea how this guy has made thousands of random mechanisms that are different, but yeah, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUNgQ1GLz2Q) basically was what i was thinking about! a double pushing docking mechanism! it's gonna be a bit tricky to implement with spacing, but we could probably move the spring setup onto the tool head itself (as in, the part that detaches and stuff)

now, im gonna quickly update the journal over there on blueprint, since i really cant be pushing this off longer lol (its gonna just be no cad to cad in one log, which would not be super useful as a journal)

i leave this website for a week, what has happened. what is an expert mode. huh?

So uh, it's not gonna be fun calculating the hours, is it?

- 11/2/2025 - 1.5 hrs
- 11/4/2025 - 4 hrs
- 11/5/2025 - 1 hr
- 11/8/2025 - 1.75 hrs
- 11/9/2025 - 1.75 hrs
- 11/11/2025 - 1.25 hrs
- 11/12/2025 - 0.75 hrs

so 12 hrs!

quick commit before we start working on the actual cad stuff!

... does blueprint just no longer push stuff? ok then?

time for some breaking changes! in order to make our overall machine footprint to be smaller and not be excessively bulky, we're gonna make the docking bit taller and then lower the entire top section. this is because the tool isn't exactly hanging around UNDER the y rods, but actually on a similar level. this means the axis themselves (since we dont really want to damage the structure with making the x rods interfere with the vertical extrusions), needs to be on a similar level as the docking station. this also means that the right side of the extrusion frame needs to stick out to compensate for this docking area.

ok, now to put that into cad! also, its really important when buying the extrusions to get everything at once, since shipping is INSANE WHAT IS $24 AAAAAH oh wait we can change it to global standard direct line for $3, oh, ok, thats much better! mfw that actually only applies if its less than 1.5 kg

nvm this shipping thing is a mess, ill sort it out later

found some pretty fairly priced [lead screws](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807271104483.html) over on aliexpress

does automation direct only use inches on their site... looking at 8020, seems decent, shipping is sorta high though (they are using ups though)

idk, lets figure that out later, it's already 1:18 PM (frc robonauts reference???), back to cadding!

could probably compact the bottom right, ok, compacted a bit!

so im watching videos on the side while working and i just got a DHL ad. i do NOT get shipping advertisments. what the data collection?

might actually switch out the y rods for a linear rail, since it would save space (since, it would be really janky to have the x and y on the same z height, or it would just take up a bunch of space), and if we have the y axis in between it also gets quite weird (and the clamps would take up the same space since belts need to run through)

also we need to find some linear bearings, might actually move the motors down a bit in height since they currently take up a signficant amount of space, then transfer rotation upwards with some rod? also, made the linear rods a bit smaller 15mm diameter may be a bit overkill (its 10mm now), tension should help it not slant?

here's the current state of things, off to lunch now! (2:22 PM right now)

ok, back at 3:15 PM! just kidding, screen seems to have frozen randomly, so that was weird. anyways, back to work at 3:20 PM!

wow, this is the first time in a while all tabs on microsoft edge beta got loaded

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11152025 - 2.png>)

anyways, time to update the frame... frame updated! currently working on cadding the belts, not sure how detailed i should go. do i cad all the widths? of course not the teeth, but still.

ok, both belts are cadded now!

ok, its 4:57 PM now and imma start working on the gearing for the extruder stepper, here's what things look like now!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202511/11152025 - 3.png>)

im gonna write a quick todo list to motivate myself:
- tool head
    - gearing research
    - do the gearing
    - optimize for height
    - lookup parts for triangle labs v6 extruder
    - add them in
    - add fan areas
    - define docking area on tool head
        - basically spring lock setup
    - optimize shape
- docking area
    - add docks
    - optimize shape

ok, we've hit 5:00 PM now, let's get to it!

dr dflo suggests a 3:1 or 5:1 ratio, ill probably do 5 just incase! now, i need to find the dp and length formula from frcdesign again... hold on a second, this isnt what used to be here? ok, went to one of my old CAD things, and found `(12/20 + 0.002) in`, im assuming 0.002 is there just for tolerances and what not? now that i think about it, its not exactly significant when were talking about out stuff, since 0.05mm isn't too much to worry about, but ill just include it anyways

this is a very big goofy sized gear, maybe 4:1 is better? switched back to 5:1 ratio, just made the filament grabbing gears a bit bigger (not to be confused with the part that actually grabs the filament, even though that would be bigger as a result of this change), so it has a bit more reasonable height

![woo](</updatelogs/images/202511/11152025 - 4.png>)

ok, gearing is there (haven't placed the actual grabbing bits, as in the stuff that actually grabs the filament), we probably want these gears to be metal (PLA from the d shaft to maybe a hex inside is probably alright), axles should probably also be metal, not sure what i feel about using frc hex shafts, probably gonna look for a more compact solution? just looked at the little bit of hex shaft i have, yeah, i dont think thats really gonna work. also, the small gear is staying with the d shaft, the big gear would be sliding on and off, so we'll see how that goes!

5:33 PM, height seems decent, looking up parts for the extruder! (its https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832657765617.html)

thankfully, they have a parts list in there, so we can figure that out. also, yeah, we're buying from aliexpress instead of the trianglelabs site, hopefully shipping is faster that way (in retrospect, this makes no sense since aliexpress acts like a middleman between the consumer and the company, and doesn't exactly, at least to my knowledge, have giant warehouses in the amazon sense)

anyways, the parts list, so im gonna paste it here and try to find the individual parts and paste the links here, so that i can use those diagrams! (unforunately, theres no links there originally)


- [`Volcano nozzle*0.4MM(1.75MM High quality nozzly) X 1`](https://trianglelab.net/products/e3d-volcano-brass-nozzle?VariantsId=10460)
- [`heat break(1.75MM for v6 HOTEND) X 1`](https://trianglelab.net/products/v6-titanium-heatbreak-for-prusa-mmu-mmus)
- [`Volcano Heater Block for V6 Volcano hotend(for Sensor Cartridges) X 1`](https://trianglelab.net/products/volcano-heater-block?VariantsId=10599)
- `*Compatible pt100 sensor` (not significant for cad)
- [`Aluminium Heatsink X 1`](https://trianglelab.net/products/6-heatsink)
- [`Cooling fan(12v or 24v) X 1`](https://trianglelab.net/products/3010-fan?VariantsId=10141)
- `Fan bracket X 1` (not significant for cad)
- `Thermistor Cartrodge X 1` (not significant for cad)
- `Heater Cartridge(12v or 24v) X 1` (not significant for cad)

ok, marked the stuff that aren't exactly necessary to put in the cad (mostly electornics/unused), while also trying to figure out what each one means! ok, now time to find them... while looking for them, found where you can get the nozzle, heater, and heat break in a set [here](https://trianglelab.net/products/volcano-heater-block-high-quality-nozzle-heat-breaker?VariantsId=10774), lucky find since that has a LOT of diagrams!

ok, 6:18 PM and found all of them that we need! time to start cadding...

cursed forbidden method (yes thats a decal)

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11152025 - 5.png>)

switched from using julia's featurescripts threads featurescript to the default onshape one, since it was acting weird for this multiple cylinder thing (maybe its because im on V180, what version is it on now? oh V181). it also doesnt use as many (or any at all?) triangles, so thats nice for performance (doesnt look very good imo, but whatever)

ok, so nozzle and heatbreak done, its 7:24 PM (figuring out the thread thing took a bit, along with the fact that the diagrams are sorta missing a lot of dimensions), off to dinner!
