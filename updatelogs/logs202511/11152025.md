# 11/15/2025 - 13th Update!

currently 11:55 AM here in NYC! gonna start in a bit, hold on a second...

ok, its 11:59 AM now, and let's get started! so i've been doing some thinking today, and then i remembered the youtube mechanism guy that has made way too many mechanisms, `thang010146`! i have no idea how this guy has made thousands of random mechanisms that are different, but yeah, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUNgQ1GLz2Q) basically was what i was thinking about! a double pushing docking mechanism! it's gonna be a bit tricky to implement with spacing, but we could probably move the spring setup onto the tool head itself (as in, the part that detaches and stuff)

now, im gonna quickly update the journal over there on blueprint, since i really cant be pushing this off longer lol (its gonna just be no cad to cad in one log, which would not be super useful as a journal)

i leave this website for a week, what has happened. what is an expert mode. huh?

So uh, it's not gonna be fun calculating the hours, is it?

- 11/2/2025 - 1.5 hrs
- 11/4/2025 - 4 hrs
- 11/5/2025 - 1 hr
- 11/8/2025 - 1.75 hrs
- 11/9/2025 - 1.75 hrs
- 11/11/2025 - 1.25 hrs
- 11/12/2025 - 0.75 hrs

so 12 hrs!

quick commit before we start working on the actual cad stuff!
