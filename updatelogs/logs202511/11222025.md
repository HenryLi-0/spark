# 11/22/2025 - 14th Update!

ok, 6:22 PM now, its been a week, wow. ok, so yeah, time to get straight back in! udpate on blueprint, the deadline has been expanded to january 1st! this is obviously good since, well, i havent exactly been actively working on it in the past week. anyways, mini sciduck parts are printing right now (for any robotics seniors that graduated in 2025, yes, this is for you, spoiler alert)

yeah, so now for the tool setup! 6:26 PM, actual music playing, let's get to work! oh yeah, funny story, i accidentally hit my head on the whiteboard in physics this monday, kinda a bad cut behind my left ear, but its been getitng better! ok, cad loaded!

so, docking placement. we either arrange it sideways (so, longer side of the heat block facing us), which would lead to a bit of a sus wiring situation (its alright, but itll be a bit goofy) with a side of roughly 2.7cm or 2.8cm, but if we have the shorter side facing us, it would be 2.23cm. im thinking of using the 2.23cm side, since its, well, thinner, meaning more compact stuff! why is this a question? well, at first i though it would restrict printing size, but then i remembered thats the same direction as the docking area, so it doesnt really matter (in fact, its also a bit of a benefit, since we can place the docking mechansim near the hotend, of course, still with the fans)

speaking of fans, where they needed? ok, so, for the toolhead, its needed for the cold end, so it keeps the filament cool, and a part cooling fan (on the bottom, of course). so yeah, we really dont need to add these on the tool (as in, we dont need to swap these things on and off the gantry), since we can just position them well on the tool head. im thinking 2 fans for the cold end (one on left and right, if we're facing the front of the gantry (the long side of the y axis facing us)), and either 1 or 2 on the bottom.

ok, so this isnt very good, but our extruder setup sorta hits the side (aka, we want the gear NOT to stick out of that spot, or else its kinda too big) ok, changed the ratio to 1:4, so now its inside! am i going crazy or did bambu lab sell a1 mini extruder gear replacements? oh im not, ok, thats good, bambu labs seem to have 0.3cm gears on the a1 mini, but im gonna do 0.5 (both because PLA definitely is not on the same level as hardened steel, and we need the space anyways)

that said, i think we can afford to move our extruder a bit more upwards, since we currently have an issue that the tool stuff might be too low? actually, its alright, ok, 7:40 PM now, off to dinner!

yeah its 12:50 AM now.

current issue is trying to figure out how to get the extruder stepper motor gears to bridge the gap to get to the filament. well, actually, now that i think about it, we actually need to gripping gears (the ones that pull the filament) on each tool themselves, since we cant exactly slide filament out of these setups (well, in a good setup that is). this is actually pretty good, since we can use the gap to be able to make some form of docking mechanism!

ok, did a bit of editing of the heights of stuff, cleaned up the side heights sketch a bit, and here's the current setup!

ok, 1:24 AM now, good night!
