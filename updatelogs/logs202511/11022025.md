*christmassssss~*

*the snow's coming down-ah!*

*christmassssss!~*

*im watching it fa-lllll*

ok now that ive [scared every person who works in retail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EvZOXEoJ84), it's november! how've you been? i've been working on 50+ ap language assignments and 60+ videos, all in this weekend! who said you couldnt do it last second? anyways, yeah, there goes my weekend. so, its 11:50 PM on this quite chill night in NYC, time to get started! well, i still have 3 ap language videos to listen to, so i'll leave those in the background while i work! ok, time to get cadding! just kidding i instead went to draw cursed robot ideas, anyways, its 12:12 AM, one second...

ngl these videos are horrible background music, more specifically, the lack of anything musically like. quick detour, lets double check that we get how to rig coreXY!

so uh... i have a bit of a change of idea. basically, we have a pretty nice, but also pretty cursed setup going on here. here's a problem.

![uhh](</updatelogs/images/202511/11022025 - 1.png>)

notice the problem? basically, we're wasting a TON of space by placing the pulleys inside. so, if its not clear enough, i know at most half of what im talking about. hold on a second, the thinking is thinking...

we could just stack them? ok, we've stacked them. but here's another idea ive had. ok, 12:52 AM, been doing a bunch of sketching, here it is

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11022025 - 2.png>)

ok, so ive been thinking about it, credit where credit is due, [this](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/972232e523942aba5d0f08b9/w/d945accde5825e0753b0751f/e/67583ee7779ed357e9baf57a) design, which seems to be the creality K1 gantry (?) is actually pretty much what i was thinking about, which was moving the motors shown in the [corexy theory page](https://corexy.com/theory.html) to the opposite side to make belting easier. anyways, ive just realized it probably looks better to place everything on the edges than rotate that to the top, then stack that over there... ive realized this makes no sense. basically, imagine what we originally had, except we have the head facing the back and have... never mind

ok, we NEED to decide on an archieture NOW. the problem with theoriginal design is the fact that having an extra "elevate" state for the print heads is REALLY inefficient, since this moves more mass higher, meaning higher COG, while also requiring another axis. it would be smarter to be able for the coreXY to be able to access the docking area itself, then activate some swap mechanism. we can have this where the motors are located, in order to save space, while also using the motors and belts are a hard stop alignment (this may lead to wear). however, this is if th emotors are pointing upwards, meaning their bodies are part of the main frame. this could be structurely bad, but we can just connect the tops over it, or make some plate.

problem is, we either have to place the double motors in the front and have all the stuff docked there and blocking the view, or have all the stuff in the back with the toolhead facing the back (poor maitenence either way).

third idea, rotate it, and have an "electronics stack" area! ok, its gonna be hard to describe, but im just gonna edit the cad real quick!

its about to get real destructive really quickly

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11022025 - 3.png>)

there! heres a pretty rough draft, but thats the idea. anyways, remember that todo schedule list thing? yeah, push that back by a week! ok, so, the idea with this is that we can also add doors on EVERY SIDE, since i know i will be struggling to find a good orientation on my table. so, whats nice about this setup? we have an electronics area, so that our 3d printing area is seperate and keeps the electronics safe from any possible hazards or anything! the idea is that the electronics side acts more as the "working" side of it, so the ventillation duct also runs through it. ok, since its 1:40 AM, im gonna go to sleep now! gonna try to work on this on tuesday, assuming not too much work?

ok, good night!
