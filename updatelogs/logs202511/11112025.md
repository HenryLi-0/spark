# 11/11/2025 - 11th Update

no way 11th update on 11/11??? oh yeah, thank you veterans!

ok, so its 11:30 PM (no way, another 11?), since i accidentally started playing gd and then started working on robotics edits out of nowhere. yeah, i really need to start optimizing my schedule again. ok, anyways, with the minimal amount of time we have left, WE NEED TO CAD AAAAA

(also, i havent done a journal thing in a while oops)

mfw there are no complete cad models for this (they dont define every little detail)

we might need to do more part sourcing (having second thoughts about this) been looking at the [triangle labs site](https://www.trianglelab.net/products/v6-hotend?VariantsId=10055), wondering if i should just get the full part or just parts?

more sourcing, found [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803662839179.html), more expensive, but idk

why does the site say copyright 2005-2015... its definitely still around since i see a H2D thing! ok, im gonna send them an email about cad files or diagrams, brb

ok, email sent! anyways, after sending it, i just realized that i might not need that information. oops. basically, i just realized that that extruder is REALLY tall. is there a shorter heatsink?

wait a second, are these all bowden setups...

yeah i really need help with this extruder thing, time to visit [infill](https://infill.hackclub.com/) once again!

maybe shoving the motor in the middle was not a good idea...

hey local, guess what? internet just exploded. oh we're back now!

hmm i guess it's alright? im just gonna put in arbitary values until they respond

just kidding im being forced to go to sleep now, its 12:44 AM, ok, good night!
