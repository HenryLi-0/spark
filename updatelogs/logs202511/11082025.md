# 11/8/2025 - 9th Update!

i've spent the entirety of today being a very lazy bum not doing much, woke up at 1 pm, oops

well, after playing gd and shapez 2 for a very long amount of time, i guess we start working on this again! ok, mastersketch of the motion system, continued! currently 9:38 PM here in NYC!

ok, so currently, we have a bit of an issue, where are tool head is sorta under the y axis. basically, before i really looked too hard into this, i sorta cadded the tool head under the axis (it was a lot to take in at first, ok?). this means, we gotta move the whole thing down!

you know, i really dont like those cads where all the assembly stuff arent connected, but they do some really helpful when youre taking stuff apart to see how it works! however, if its your own cad, please actually mate the stuff correctly in assembly lol

now, a big question, do we put the stepper motor on the toolhead or base? putting it on the moving bit would make swaps relatively simple (ill get to this in a bit), but putting it at the base will also be simple, with the downside of potentially needing another axis in order use less stepper motors. anyways, here's what i wanted to explain

TOOL HEAD SWITCHING!
- 4 motors for 4 tool heads? what? you're only using 1 at once!
- n-1 extra motors? what are you, insane?
- solution? 1 motor!
- how?
    - keep the motor ON the carriage
    - when we swap, we swap GEARS of an extruder!
- we cant cheap the extruders, since that would just be basically normal filament switching, which sort of defeats the purpose of having multiple print heads, so we need n extruders
- but we dont need n motors! we only need 1.
- this comes with the downside of making swaps more dificult, but i'm sure we can find a solution!
- docking manuever:
    - retract filament by a bit
    - disengage the gear on the extruder motor, and leave that in empty dock A
    - now without an extruder, navigate to occupied dock B
    - engage the gears and mechanism
    - load filament by a bit
    - now with an extruder, exit the now empty dock B
    - go to a cleaning area to reheat the extruder
    - continue printing!
- and that should help make things a bit cheaper!
- downsides:
    - alignment must be REALLY good and reliable
    - adds potential mechanical wear areas
    - gears MUST self align, or else it's gonna be really goofy/inaccurate
- benefits:
    - cheaper
    - would be REALLY satisfying if it worked
    - technically makes tool changes faster? (you dont need to move the entire stepper motor off the carriage)

but yeah, that's the idea! anyways, i need to find that extruder stepper motor again and model it...

wait its literally the same thing, just shorter

short boi

anyways, yeah, 10:22 PM now, gonna go watch a movie! after this, adding the side profiles of the stepper motors to the mastersketch, and adding the stepper onto the gantry, and start work on the extruder in the mastersketch! also, we REALLY need to start focusing, because programming and electronics will NOT be particularly easy.

ok its 12:19 AM now! back to cadding... ok, so im gonna actually move the Z axis motor away from that side since its kinda hitting stuff? actually, maybe not, since it might not? idk, i need to do more dimension stuff

so the build plate (theoretical) and screw get as close as 0.135 cm at one point, which is pretty scary.

you know, before i start playing with more numbers, we should actually find a decent heat bed? oh wow, so i remember dr d flo (hi again) and this guy has some insane docs written up. not sure how old it is, but it is pretty impressive and handy. anyways, [here's](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Guides/How-to-Build-a-3D-Printer/Print-Bed.html) their docs on print beds!

been looking for something that isn't too expensive and has decent size and isn't super sketchy, found [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Ender-V2-Heated-Bed-Replacement/dp/B08VHTW8CQ/) on amazon, not sure if it's exactly good (since when did amazon put p return warnings?)

anyways, 12:46 AM, left to fix something, back at 1:02 AM, where was i? oh right, the amazon thingy is 235mm by 235mm, so lets put those numbers in!

well, 0.385 cm is better, but not by much...

hold on a second, what are we doing? we could just fit the motor inside the electronics area and belt everything. ok, its 1:27 AM now, here's the progress for today!
