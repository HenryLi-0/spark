# 11/12/2025 - 12th Update!

it's 1:26 AM on 11/13/2025, but im gonan squeeze out as much time as i have in this day! unfortunately, the current state of things with the email is that they havent replied yet, so idk. previously today, i was searching something up and then suddenly ended up on the triangle labs site again somehow? oh right, i looked for cad files and most of them were kinda limited (at least in grabcad).

but that's when i had an ephiphany! a revelation of sorts! ok, a bit dramatic, but i realized i can get the specific specific bits on the site itself. yeah, shouldve came to me a lot sooner. today's goal in the half hour is to source the stuff, then maybe add the heights to the cad.

also while i was showering today, i though of the docking and locking mechanism! unforunately, not much time to draw it, but the stepper motor will be mounted in the middle, with the bottom doing all the docking business. i might need to move some things.

half way through this, i found that they [already sell](https://www.trianglelab.net/products/volcano-threaded-hotend?VariantsId=11081) what we're making at a pretty neat price. alright. (this site is so unnavigatable sometimes...) (maybe also get like 2 hardened steel volcano nozzles for future stuff? idk, depends on if we go over budget)

it also seems that they sell a bunch of stuff made up of their own stuff but in strange configurations. [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832657765617.html) is different, but also the same ish thing, but its also different in that it has a fan, but is also somehow cheaper. i'm probably gonna use this one, since it seems to most reviewed out of all that, and i dont want to want forever for a risk of a package not coming.

(just noticed we walked a full circle, this is the same one from the voron sourcing guide. oops.)

can i find cad files rarhalkfasdkljf

mfw im 100% not catching this alliexpress deal (this explains the weird money thing, since aliexpress is currently giving ~$13 off to get ~$7, so it does just to ~$20 without any sales) oh just found it on the triangle labs site [here](https://trianglelab.net/products/v6-threaded-hotend?VariantsId=10062).
