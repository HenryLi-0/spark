# 11/5/2025 - 8th Update!

ok, it's pretty late today, at 12:50 AM on 11/6/2025, but we'll take what we got!

first things first, im gonna search jlcmc for pulleys, to see what we're working with at the ends. the goal today is to fully cad the mastersketch of the motion system, and possibly start work on it today!

i was thinking that we could probably 3d print a custom one, but let's see if theres any metal ones first, since this component is pretty important!

what if we just use bearings ok nvm

ok, no [d hole pulleys](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/C03/CBTM/timing-belt-pulley-d-hole-s3m-3.0-s5m-5.0), probably gonna use the ones with clamps? oh nvm i meant shaft collars (raven flashbacks)

anyways, [here](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/C03/CBTL/timing-belt-pulley-set-screw-clamping-high-torque-arc-teeth-s3m-3.0-s5m-5.0-s8m-8.0) ya go, seems good? 

so i cant find any of them that actually do a bit above 5mm? the bore diamter of 5 ones have a diamter of 4mm for some reason. anyways, lets get mastersketching!

i just searched for gt2 belts in jlcmc and it seems like [theres](https://jlcmc.com/product/b/C03/BR5565/gt2-20t-timing-pulley-(inner-diameter-5mm-width-6mm)) some actual 5mm gt2 timing pulleys. huh.

you know, i think you tell how much sleep i got when i kept searching "gt2 pulley" (keyword: PULLEY) while wondering where all the belts are. jlcmc really needs to finish making their site or something lol, anyways, i *think* [these](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/C02/CDTM/timing-belts-2gt) are some belts? need to double check if 2gt and gt2 are the same things

1:38 AM and adding pulley stuff, my eyes are getting tired or something

ok, its 1:48 AM now, and im about to fall asleep, so here's the progress!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202511/11052025 - 1.png>)

doesn't look like much, but really changed the parametric structure stuff, moved lots of things into side heights (the red sketch that goes in the center of everything vertically)! should make aligning things easier as its all defined by one sketch. so i guess that kinda makes that a master master sketch?

anyways, that's it for today, super eepy, yeah. wow, 1:50 AM, basically exactly an hour, ok, good night!
