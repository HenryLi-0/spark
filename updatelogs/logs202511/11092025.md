# 11/9/2025 - 10th Update!

as per my typical inability to lock in when given long time periods to work on stuff until it becomes the last minute or it becomes night time, im back at 11 PM, here in NYC! that second part's not changing any time soon, im gonna be in new york city probably until like next march or something. idk. (that's gonna be hudson valley regionals! although, i do like greater pittsburgs regionals' venue lol (iykyk, hint, around the first weekend of july))

ok, after a minute or two of looking at that venue a bit too long (look at that roof, wow so cool), let's get back to cadding! we have, lets see, three weeks left, so im guessing one more week for CAD, one for electronics/sourcing, one for programming and shipping? ok, lets get going!

hold on a second, what do you mean i could just shove the motor there... hold on a second...

ok, before i start cadding this, let me see how the extrusion drive works and all, and find an extruder!

ok, so we doing direct drive, but idk what extruder and model specifically, more researching... (also, note that it will need to be cheap, since, well, we're gonna have multiple extruders)

what the, ok, something weird just happened, but im here to say that we're gonna be doing lots of custom stuff here, as expected when you decide to make a custom docking solution. basically, we're not going FULLY custom, but largely so. what i mean, is that we're gonna use the COTS motors and extruders and hotends, but we're gonna be working on how to get the filament from input and into the extruder section, along with placing the fan and stuff. 

lets list the todo!
- filament drive (probably a 5:1 gear reduction for the motor?)
- filament path (make a good one! no sharp bends, PTFE guide tube, etc.)
- tensioning (need to adjust filament and what not) (probably some spring?)
- material choices (would be nice to 3d print everything, but it really needs to be accurate and NOT MELT PLEASE REALLY IMPORTANT WE DO NOT WANT THE SETUP MELTING)
    - no way, they made bearings that small? (625 and 626 bearings for idlers)
- motor coupling/mounting
    - VERY STABLE, keep the motors very close to the drive gears (probably just main -> reduction -> drive) (no wiggly wobbly)

through infill, found [the voron sourcing guide](https://vorondesign.com/sourcing_guide), which looks pretty cool, trying to find individual parts (hot part and nozzle, specifically). while i was there, take a look at [these cool ptfe tube connector thingies](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832747833403.html)! probably will use a couple of these too!

[triangle lab v6 hotend](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832657765617.html) from the sourcing guide, seems pretty good, but not sure how trustworthy it is? (well, in all fairness, not a ton of people are buying hotends) problem also is, i dont really see any measurements anywhere, or at least, a full diagram?

wait, if we want to talk about nozzles, heres:
- [brass ones](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832653029356.html) (~$2.50 each)
- [hardened steel ones](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832693198080.html) (~$9 each)

obviously, big price difference, but well get to addressing that later (am i really gonna be using cf stuff anytime soon? probably not. if we are, tool switching probably wont be a feature? anyways, hardened steel would be cool, and footprints seem similar? oh wait, they're the same.)

yeah, we might use these! now, to find other footprints... (did i just say footprints? i guess kicad still influences me to today...) once again HUGE SHOUTOUT to voron's sourcing guide (well, i dont think you need me to shoutout, but still, credit where credit is due!) for a BUNCH of parts! also, [that PSU](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/LRS-200-24/7705026) seems pretty good! anyways, a bit too ahead of ourselves, time to find more parts for the extruder!

reading [more docs](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Guides/How-to-Build-a-3D-Printer/Extruder.html) (once again, another drdflo apperance!)

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11092025 - 1.png>)

sorry idk why i found that so funny, anyways, [another thing](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255799825795638.html)! for future me, itll probably be helpful more me to mention thats the hotend. anyways, now we need a thermistor and heater thing!

aw, was gonna use [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832656515068.html) heatsink (yes, im pulling tons of stuff form the voron guides), but its no longer available...

here's a [thermistor](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832843394819.html), and [limit switch](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/omron-electronics-inc-emc-div/D2F-5L/8593137), and [ac inlet](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adam-tech/IEC-GS-1-100/9831135)

ok, so its 12:46 AM now, today was mostly just sourcing stuff, not too much cad work, but yeah, that's a pretty good start! turning the mastersketch into actual stuff should be straightforward once we sort everything out now instead of fixing way too much stuff later on. ok, good night!
