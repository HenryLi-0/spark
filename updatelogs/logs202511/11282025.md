# 11/28/2025 - 16th Update!

ok, 3:41 PM on a... friday? here in NYC! no school today, but this is still gonna be a busy weekend (exams and stuff upcoming, need to prepare for kickoff too). how are you doing? kinda unforunate that the housepets comic website (at least the original one) is down right now, but yeah, time to get back to work! gonna try to put this project on the fast track/higher priority since january is approaching faster than it seems

so yeah! what today? not software, we're gonna be working on the docking mechanism and tool head stuff today! oh yeah, its black friday today right? no im not gonna be buying anything today

while eating outside yesterday, i realized that the stepper motors were kinda in a goofy position if we're talking about space optimization. now, you may be asking, are we this desperate for like 2 cm of extra space? yeah kinda i guess. i mean, its better to choose function over asthetics right?

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11282025 - 1.png>)

so yeah, the stepper motors should be indented in on the front and back not the right side! curretn gap space is `21.54 cm`! ok, changes made, belts fixed, game is `23.54 cm` now!

currently thinking up what sort of setup we're gonna have for the tool (how does one mount the extruder? planning to use pla (maybe cnc?) for the holding bit, but heat transfer and stuff? how do you fasten it?)

ok, so it seems that you grab it by the heatsink? ok, so for docking, im thinking of only having one "lock" with the others just being passive (think of like a cone shape and a matching cone shape guide hole), since having multiple locks is risky as it increases the chance of failure (tehcnically, if designed well, it won't fail, but lets not get that confident). so, one or maybe two at most! (also, adding springs and what not probably wont be fun so easier assembly i guess)

oh right we need part cooling

i might actually just fit this fan on the bottom, sorta like the way the bambu lab a1 mini does it, since putting it on the top just doesnt work with this setup. in terms of asthetics, i think im gonna go for a "blocky" feel, but its still gonna be smooth. also, im currently thinking of how to make the fan stay to the frame when the everything else is able to slide around.

maybe some magnets would help out with the locking thing...

![uhh](</updatelogs/images/202511/11282025 - 2.png>)

we do stuff

anyways, realized the detachable part of the tool head, i guess the tool, need to have both a key and lock system, since it needs to lock with the toolhead and the frame? ive just confused myself

not sure where to fit the second lock...

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202511/11282025 - 3.png>)

and here it is! a (mostly) complete tool head! the two rectangles over there are the latches (im just gonna call the locking mechanisms latches at this point), so the idea is we have the latch on the gantry (or tool base) near the back where the stepper motor is! anyways, i guess time to work on the docking station?

ok, what color to use for these sketches... also, just updated the z axis to be blue instead of purple, oops

ok so we can fit roughly 5 (maybe 6 if we can shave half a cm off the y length of the tool head) tools right now. ok, 6:07 PM now (haha funny number, anyways), gonna be right back. ok, 6:21 PM now (haha, funny number again, coincidence, anyways), back to work!

ok, shaved half a cm off the y length of the tool head, but that's not really gonna help with much because we still cant span the entire y axis of the printer (at least the part between the aluminum extrusions), since we have the linear rods holding things somewhere there.

stunning realization! the locking thing in the back? yeah, i dont think teleporting through a linear rod is quite possible yet.

ok, that looks better?

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11282025 - 4.png>)

moved the latch for the gantry and tool to in between the y rods, which both looks decently compact and makes sense.

did some more measurements, realized that we didnt account for the fact that the big gear kinda gets in the way of locking stuff, edited spacing, now 5 tools dont really fit well (or at least comfortably with the clearances i was hoping for) on the side. currently 6:55 PM, off to dinner!

ok 9:45 PM and were back for a bit

yeah, so this gear is always gonna stick out (if we keep the 1:4 ratio, which is kinda ideal) (yes i tried it with 32DP, still like that, 8 teeth gear sounds cursed), so we'll probably do a 1:2 followed by a 1:2 to get a 1:4 reduction. ok, 10:00 PM, off to go watch a movie!

ok, back at 11:51 PM, imma make a devlog in blueprint's site... just kidding, this definitely isnt significant content yet. gonna do something real quick... ok, 12:17 AM, anyways, back to gear work!

hmm 17:50 is cursed

ok, did the stuff, 32DP, 1:2 and 1:2 resulting in a 1:4 ratio done, seems to fit! did a bit more measuring and it doesnt seem like i could make the top any shorter? ok, been quick a bit, played around with more placements, and i think i shaved a good roughly a centimeter off the top? had a good docking idea and then realized that it means the front of the heater block touches the metal, which i probably wouldnt want. (well, now looking at it, it probably will have to touch it or poke into the main area, unless i increase the frame size?)

well, that's gonna be it for me tonight! currently 12:48 AM, good night!
