# 11/29/2025 - 17th Update!

yeah accidentally spent most of the day playing gd. yeah. (nine circles is a pretty terrifying level, got to 18% ish, yeah.)

anyways, 10:09 PM here in NYC, and we're back! if i remember correctly, we're making sure docking works, as in:
- latch areas are possible (gantrty to tool, tool to frame)
- docking areas are reachable
- docking areas do not conflict

i just realized the sketch actually showed the middle middle middle aluminum extrusion to be the thing on the side, i guess we're adding another extrusion?

ok, stuff updated gonna work on the linear rod holding bits of the frame

should the linear rods be in tension? as in, not like, rope stretching tension, but at least have their lengths clamped down and put across the span distance so that if it every starts to slop there would be tension preventing such situation?

did a bit of searching, doesnt seem to make much of a difference, oh well. anyways, changed the diameter of the rods to be `1.2cm` instead of `1.0cm`. kinda thick rods but yeah. anyways, still gonna give the option to place a screw at the end to tighten/clamp around the rods, in case i missed something (and because it kinda makes sense to me?)

hmm currently wondering how we're gonna allow the gussets to work on it...

while working on the stuff, i just realized we never checked for collisions in the x direction

so uh... in the -x direction, we dont exact have the full distance for the tool to fill the area. yeah i dont know how i oversaw this.

so we have two choices, either move the stepper motor and to the top and the cooling fan to the top (and have some way to shoot the air stream downwards), or add a couple extra centimeters to the frame. now, i would love to keep the stepper motor where it is, since it's very stable and compact, and i think moving the stepper motor and cooling fan to the top is both bad for the looks for things, and the structure.

ok, so i just had an idea. its gonna be a ton of extra work, but yeah. also, the reason why i really dont want to expand the frame is because it'll just be empty space on the bottom the doesn't have any activity except for like z screws. this is bad since its kinda just wasted space, along with the fact that the rods have to go farther just to fit.

im gonna lose it if digikey doesnt stop giving me robot press and holds. yeah, i spent 8 minutes doing them and i cant access the site. oh well. anyways, since i cant find the dimensions of the PSU, we're gonna have to hope that it fits.

theres actually a third option, which is moving the entire electronics part to the left instead of the right, or swapping the side of tool and moving the docking area to the other side and reversed, of course. however, while it does work out to keep the structure, the downside is that the resting state is to have the thermistor wire stretch across the entire printer, which is both scary, and probably will cause collision issues. yes, i did have to stare at the cad for a bit to come to this conclusion. (ideally, only one "tube" is ever active, which is the current tool) (well, it might actually not collide, but i dont really wanna take any chances?) (we could also make the wire longer but that's also probably not good because of possibly creating signals and also making resistance and what not)

therefore, i think the best solution is moving the motor to the top. BUT WAIT! there's another idea. expanding the size between the linear rods to actually fit the motor inside. this keeps good structure, and is already pretty close to whats happening already (it already has a pretty big gap, the latch can also go there (well, it already is...)). the only issue is the part cooling fan placement, where i think we either use the heat sink air (just kidding that was a joke, that's probably a bad idea), or "do the think bambu lab does", as in, stick the fan on the bottom.

so yeah, that's the plan. oh yeah, one more benefit, this allows us to dock more "close up". unfortunately, this doesn't fully solve our problem (we are 1cm off), so itll also be a combination of this and moving the base. yeah, so im kinda scared right now, since these are major changes, but let's go!

unforseen issue that was forseeable, the exturder motor is so big that it goes inside the heatsink. so, now we are faced with "hmm" once again. surprise new idea, we can place the extruder motor backwards and do the gearing on the -x (aka, left) side. unfortunately, this is very goofy, and also might collide with the back aluminum extrusions. also, wiring will be cursed.

sooo... yeah. we only have one choice, which is to move the motor to the top. i mean, its not the end of the world, we'll get to compact the lower parts a bit. yeah, this is pretty bad, since theres now a problem that there's no suitable place for the gantry to tool latch, well, in retrospect, the original setup we had at the start of today didnt really work either. actually, it did, since we never made contact with the stepper and instead stayed in front of it.

scary idea, but here we go. we increase the spacing again, and place the fan in the middle there.

yeah, now the stepper shaft is in the way of everything.

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11292025 - 1.png>)

i dislike the idea of there being so much airspace, but i guess its fine. so side by side comparison, new thing is skinnier but taller (yeah completely crazy news huh).

cylodial gear box? nah. i dont like the current setup (it looks a bit too extreme, as in, its way too tall), but i guess ill get used to it. currently, trying to setup the gearing has become a nightmare.

you know what? im gonna revert all these changes. yeah, i really dislike this solution, since its structurely suspicious, spacing suspicious, and overall just not compact and a bit imbalanced in weight distribution. yeah, just undid all that. maybe the solution was the easiest one, just extend the -x side by 3 cm. what am i gonna do with 3 extra cm? i dont know. i really dont. but im quite out of time for today, so that's gonna have to do. maybe another electronics side or maybe ventilation, or maybe just empty, idk.

hold on a second.

now just hold on a second.

does a heater fit in there?

ok, theres NO way that fits in the budget, but in the slim slim slim chance it does, we miiiiight just add a heater. i mean, we have the space for it.

anyways, updating the cad! ok, cad updated, placing another aluminum extusion there is probably wasteful but its also probably necessary (z axis look VERY shaky right now). yeah, so im kinda lost on what i should do here. ah yes! i just had an idea, lets extend the z axis to the edges, that way we could fit some empty space there (i guess you could put like, uh, a screen i guess over there? idk). unfrotunately, if that is the case, it might ruin, nvm, i was gonna say future heater, but that's not true, we can just create a diagonal around it.

while playing around with a tape measure to try to visualize this, i did a bit of talking to myself and realized i never wrote down my plans for the tools!
- x3 extruder setups is probably the max of anything id ever do (seriously, you dont really need more than 3, unless youre printing like a rainbow or something)
- x1 pencil/pen holder (because i never updated my pr before blot got shutdown and idk when its coming back. so it returns in corexy form instead of cantilever something)
- x1 DRILL RAHHH (this is probably not gonna happen. you're not gonna fit a drill and electrically wire it. i think.)

again, the idea is that its super customizable, so you could fit like a gripper on it and get the stepper motor to control the opening and closing.

it would be ideal to have a mechanism that disables moving the filament once docked, since we will need to have some way for the stepper motor to reliably slide in and out of controlling the extrusion gears. (probably some lift with a spring? only fear is that the spring has to keep it locked in during printing/when the stepper actually wants to control) yeah, the thing with passive mechanisms (aka, the latch) is that in the chance it doesn't function perfectly, we can't exactly stop it. anyways, back to stuff!

ok, working on the switchback pulley belt thing in the corexy blocks, should i use fillet or chamfer?

ok, did a mix, not sure how we're gonna be able to install a pulley at the moment, but here you go!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202511/11292025 - 2.png>)

yeah, just one side for now, cant figure out how to mirror and then flip it for the other side, guess we'll just have to do it again? but for now, its 1:50 AM, so yeah, good night!
