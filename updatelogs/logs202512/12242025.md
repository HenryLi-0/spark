# 12/24/2025 - 21th Update!

yep, its some how 6:14 PM already. not sure where most of the day went, but i did wake up a bit late today. anyways, also completed multiple map packs today, but yeah, gonna quickly write yesterdays log, then discuss what i did the last couple days, and then get cadding the corexy stuff!

ok, 6:28 PM and done writing that! so, while waiting for robotics to start on monday, decided to search for linear bearings, found LM12UU to be for 12mm linear rods (the ones we have), which are 3cm long (our tool gantry is 5cm long, so thats a bit unfortunate)

bad news, just did a couple checks and realized that the frame needs to be a bit wider in the y direction, since we aren't able to fully do the entire space. this bom is scaring me

while scouting amazon, im getting very worried that we are really going to go over budget

oh yeah, i also did some looking up motherboard stuff, and that is also gonna chunk out of the budget

you know what, im just gonna finish this project first, try to cheap out in places i can, then figure out how much over we are and how we can get that under, if not, im willing to pay a bit for this project?

we should also assemble the frame real quick in assembly, im gonna do that real quick, 6:53 PM now

ok, added corner gussets to the top, not sure what to do on the sides since they, well, don't exactly provide easy places to put them.

7:16 PM, ok, extruded the belts and linear rods, off to dinner!

9:40 PM now, no, dinner was not that long. updated the corners for the bearing width, new issue! probably wont be able to fit the head of a screw in 0.2cm. why is onshape suspiciously slow all of a sudden, ok updated the corners

![wha](</updatelogs/images/202512/12242025 - 2.png>)

im not sure it works like that (why did it update itself wrong aaa) why did both belts decide to destroy themselves. after trying to fix the belt sketches themselves multiple times, realized the issue was in the base pulley sketch, since it was forcing the inner, other solution, so yeah, that fixed, everything fixed itself. anyways, im noticing a bunch of input delay with bluetooth devices, so thats interesting

ok, so we'll have the same "slider" archetecture here, im thinking? just kidding, we have both x and y axis pulls here, so that'll pop out, something diagonal will likely interfere with the stability of the side, so yeah.

well, its 10:30 PM, gonna go watch sonic the hedgehog.

12:30 AM, was a pretty nice movie! anyways, about the blocks. yeah.

well, after a bit of thinking, i looked to my table next to me and see the incomplete parts of `raven`, and realized, i can add screws. yeah, a maesuremnt later, i realize that a screw isnt really that thick (well, depending on the ones you get, i remember the specs of that one, they are M4 screws. i think?) (yes, just checked, they are M4 screws!) (yes yes, i know, we need to finish that, im thinking right after i ship this ill get to finishing that?) but yeah, min distance between the y rods and the side of it is 0.9cm

also, referencing that one image from back from 12/20/2025, yeah it's not gonna be able to reach all the way in. hey, henry a minute or two into the future, yeah, past henry was wrong. i forgot we specifically addressed this problem with the corner of the corners, and they wont collide with the mounting areas because, well, the entire linear rod setup goes between the corners, and the corners of the corners of the corners are cut in that direction to allow for support while also allowing for the slider thing to get through. anyways, point is, we're adding M4 screws, we aren't screwed over (see what i did there (sorry)), yeah.

wow has it really been an hour? wrapping up on bits of organization, but the x slider switch area thing is here!

yeah, a lot happened in the past hour, including my contact lense (one of them) deciding to take a trip to the top of my eye behind my eyelid. didnt feel very good, would not recommend trying. anyways, yeah. after looking at this picture a little longer, ive noticed a big issue called "this actually doesnt solve the issue of putting in the bearing".

yeah, its 2:00 AM though, so i think im gonna head off to bed and fixing it in the morning. ok, good night! oh yeah, its 12/25/2025, so merry christmas! ok, good night, i might do onshape in bed, but probably not, mobile app experience isnt the best for cadding. ok, good night!
