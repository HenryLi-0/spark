# 12/29/2025 - 26th Update!

ok, 9:18 AM, wow, its been a while since ive seen a morning time... not exactly early early, but we'll take it over 3:00 PM. today's grind day! i have te radio tuned and playing music now, just for now, since, well, chistmas music isnt exactly the best to work to (well, they have increased variety now that christmas has passed, but still)

anyways, enough talk about music. what are we doing today? first things off, working on that connection. wait, this should be in bullet points

- Finish connection (stepper -> gearing)
    - Use fillets and chamfers like, everywhere (obviously)
    - Keep in mind printing (because long parts that twist around each other obviously is a weak point)
- Gearbox
    - A gear box with a plate in the middle may be required
    - Axles??? Probably loose PLA fitting with grease?
        - "but pla warp" yeah but idk if i can get more bearings ok (and 0.9cm diameter gear doesnt really have space for a bearing, but it also doesn't need to because side but still bearing expensive, no 1.125 inch OD with 0.5in ID bearings will not work for this)
- Whatever's going on with the cool end fan
    - fillet fillet fillet
- Check clearances
    - as in, checking that the tool can actually slide into the tool base
- Work on moutning the v6 extruder
    - idk how this thing mounts honestly, pretty sure it just uses the cold end for support
    - whatever it is, make that mounted to the tool
- Front plate
    - Part of the tool, just give it some screw holes here and there
- Combine
    - Add the gearbox to the extruder area to the front plate, probably with a couple of screws
- Add side latches
    - To do the latching things, also source a couple springs because this isn't 3d printable
- CHECK CLEARANCES
    - make sure the tool can actually slide into the tool base
    - make sure the heater does not melt the entirety of the tool
- part cooling fan
    - shouldnt invade in any space, since it's at the bottom, just see the best that can be made
    - not looking for perfection, can always be reiterated/updated through sim
- locking connection
    - some mechanism tbd to lock the tool in with a motor
    - would do something like a deadbolt lock but i dont like the idea of a rack and pinion (i mean, if it works it works, so maybe?)
        - oh i even have a rack (its just a rack lol) featurescript, thats nice

ok, 9:45 AM, i need to turn off all my alarms from last night oops

note to self, 1.2mm aka 0.12cm of material is decently rigid. or is that 1mm? idk, the calipers are acting a bit funny today.

quick break 9:45 AM to 10:15 AM, did you know the effects of waking up this early means you get the sleep deprived edition of me? yeah im a bit tired right now. also all the gd songs are escaping into my playlist lol

ok, im back, time to get to work! first, finishing that connection, starting off slow, then the gearbox. ok, let's do this!

important side quest, updated the extrusion side gearing to actually have spaces for the gears to move pass each other (1mm, aka 0.1cm)

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12292025 - 1.png>)

this gear featurescript is kinda sad

ok, been trying to move gears around, think im ok with just using the circles (gd reference???) and then using their mate connectors, have unparametric tooth counts (cant do anything about this for now, not really gonna write a featurescript right now) (i mean we could have constants for it but eh), then use a transform feature to shift it forward to where it should be. now, i was wondering how we were gonna keep a distance between the gearbox and the tool base, but i realized, you dont. since they're meant to touch anyways, there isnt really a need to add printability between those flat sides. only thing to worry about is the axle somehow scratching or having friction against the tool base.

ok, 11:14 AM, gonna go stretch real quick, back at 11:33 AM!

ok, so for the gears, i think we're gonna do the "fake bearings" thing, as in, it acts like a bearing, technically is a bearing, but isnt really a bearing but more just things sliding next to each other. well that's technically a bearing, but the point is, its sorta like what i did for the swerve of my recreation of a swerve module, as in the part where the lower area spins around. basically, its two parts with the "indent" going in one of them and going out in one of them, so they dont slide out but still slide around each other. anyways, we're probably gonna do that with a dead axle instead of a live axle, since that just stop the problem of the axles grinding against the tool base itself! the only issue is that it is quite a large clearance, which could be bad for gear accuracy, but im sure we can tune it

wait we might as well just make the gears just slide around the axles themselves with the same clearances

little issue with gearing numbers, was poking a bit too much out because gears do that

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12292025 - 2.png>)

pro tip: pocket your plastic parts not to save weight but because it looks cool

jokes aside, not exactly sure pocketing it is stronger, on one side, we dont have a giant slab, but on another side, we have more walls and thus mot material in the plane to also support it. oh yeah, doing this most likely will slow down printing time, but i guess it sort of justifies itself.

oh yeah, also changed the width from 0.15cm to 0.2cm

yeah that needs a connection, because the first gear (the one thats connected directly to the motor gearbox connection) would just be floating if this connected, we actually do have to support that... (do we need to make 3 gearbox plates???) im gonna use bigger "fake bearings" for this!

just did a bit more playing around with the durability of yesterday's gears, and i think they will very likely hold up well! in fact, it only stopped reliably spinning when i rubbed the teeth of the smaller gear against the texture back of the larger one, in which it just started reshaping. it actually didnt stop, it actually spin pretty ok with that. it only started to really fail when i used some metal snip shears to actually put some work and pressure to get it cut in half. with this, i think it'll do the job of holding itself up for multiple prints!

anyways, back to cad!

ok, its 2:00 PM now, quite the morning, i think we should be able to get on track to get most of this done today? i mean, we kinda gotta, but imma take a break probably until after lunch for now!

ok, 3:01 PM and back from lunch! time to finish the gearbox! unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a good place for the other side of the connection gear axle to be placed, since a full sized plate gets cut off by other gears, and a half plate with screws has no place to put screws. therefore, as much as i don't think it's a good idea, we might need to just use spacers and hope that it sticks together and a drop of super glue here and there. imma be back in like half an hour, one moment

ok, 3:33 PM and we're actually back! just did a couple push ups to wake up and continue my streak thing im doing for myself! yes, now my upper arm muscles hurt. after spending a bit too long fixing bad looking pocketing, the plates (should) be done!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12292025 - 3.png>)

so what next? we still need to add spacers, bearings, and axles, but im gonna act like its done for now and move on to the cool end fan "whatever"s and then mounting the v6 extruder, since im not exactly the most excited about adding a bunch of spacers everywhere (it's pretty simple but tedious work)

quick write down of oversights, placing the octagon shape of the gearbox plate right on the same octagon shape of the base might be a problem if it ever gets stuck or wiggles (it shouldnt wiggle into it, since it should be stable with all the axles and stuff, but still)

surprise surpise, major oversight, we have very large fans.

currently 4:30 PM, imma take a long break here, kinda getting tired.

ok, back at 5:14 PM! yes, having early start times means you get the kinda sleepy version of me. ok, updated now! not me, i meant the cad. anyways, v6 mounting time!

something something wind tunnel

ok, fixed misplaced fans (they were slightly too high because of wrong line)

wait how do you actually mount the v6. i guess im just gonna add like an extra holding thing at the top since idk how stable gripping it by the sides really is lol

ok, we also need to somehow mount this bottom thing to the top. im thinking top plate long thing, front (being +x) plate also, two mounting places better than one?

ok, 7:00 PM, im off to dinner, gonna grind the rest of this by the end of today, part cooling doesnt matter for now, its also probably sorta a thing we do at the end where we can actually test it out

ok, 8:45 PM and back!

ok, so its now nearing 10:00 PM. progress?

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12292025 - 4.png>)

yeah, we got a clamp thing. whats that random blue gear? finally time to start working on the thing that, you know, actually grips onto the filament, and realized that the last gear in the gearbox should have a larger exit, since, well, it needs an output (and you aint getting an output from a dead axle)

so what's left to do today?
- finish gearbox output fix
- get some setup for the dead axle
- cad the front plate
- do the tedious spacer work
- mounting and check clearances

and that should be the extruder for now, yes, we still have latches, but that could wait till tomorrow. then we do that and the loading bay tomorrow, and then do the z axis, then clean up and work on BOM and go over electronics, then hopefully ready to ship by the 31st.

mfw idk

anyways, something something deadaxle with spin spin stop long gap

ok, added gap circle if you havent noticed im quite tired and just typing words, try to make it out, you probabaly could?

ok, so its 10:24 PM now, im gonna go watch a movie now, see ya in a bit!

ok 12:10 AM, so while watching a movie, i decided to check slack real quick, and found that the deadline has been extended to the end of january. horray! gonna still try to complete as much as i can before school starts again, since build season is gonna hit really hard this year (we're locking in), so yeah, good news, but i still have stuff i need to do this break, so finishing it this year (haha get it since 2025 is ending (ok)) is probably ideal

but yeah, that's it for tonight! good night!
