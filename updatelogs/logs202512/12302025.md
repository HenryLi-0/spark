# 12/30/2025 - 27th Update!

ok, 5:00 PM today, what are we doing today? well, what's the list from yesterday?

- finish gearbox output fix
- get some setup for the dead axle
- cad the front plate
- do the tedious spacer work
- mounting and check clearances

oh. well, here's the thing, since it got extended, i no longer have to hooribly rush this (i still need to get this done), but i would like to still keep this pace. lemme pull up a calendar real quick... ok, so todays tuesday, 12/30/2025, and tomorrow is the last day of 2025. meanwhile, 2026 starts on a thursday, and school resumes on monday. so, not counting today, we have 5 days, a couple of which i would like spending for the multiple midyears that are about to greet me the second school resumes. and after that first solid five days of school, that saturday (1/10/2026) is kickoff for FRC. one kickoff happens, i will practically disappear and have to work on that. midwinter recess isnt until past mid february, so we can't count on a third extension. therefore, break is realistically the only time i have (since, i really really really want this FRC year to be better than ever). but yeah, essentially, i gotta lock in. now, i do want to make another project with blueprint, but im gonna have to somehow squeeze that into the FRC schedule (which, will not work, but we'll see).

anyways, for now, i think i have 3 days of logs to catch up on?

yeah, took half an hour to write all that. anyways, CAD time! also, since i want to draw some day, there may or may not be art on the parts. who knows.

wait this geometry is very weird to visualize give me a second. im not exactly sure how to do this?

ok, so we for certain have a dead axle, that's a given. so the last gearing needs to have a hexagon connected to the final gears (the ones attached to the filament grabbing). this means that the final gear of the 1:4 reduction, the gear that meshes with the other filament grabbing area, and the filament grabbing itself, have to be combined. oh.

now, that hexagon can't touch the deadaxle. well, it can, but for friction, let's not. if we put a small bearing (as in the "fake bearings"), it'll probably get too big, so i hope the "fake bearings" on the final gear would be able to hold it up. now mentioning that, the 12 teeth gears kinda dont have the space for such, so they'll have to probably also just have a inner hole diameter greater than the dead axle. then i guess we can have the other end of the dead axle terminate somewhere later on the other end with another bearing. given the fact this all happens across 3 (ish) centimeters (max), it should be able to hold up fine?

ok updating the mastersketch one again

pro tip, want to watch a movie but dont have streaming services? assuming you have a dvd player and have a library (if you're in nyc, queens public library), check if your library has the disc, and you can just watch movies for free, legally! yes, this is why i keep watching movies this break. also, if you have the sonic the hedgehog 3 disc, please return it when you're done, thanks!

back to cad, why is this current idea making me worried? well, it's not a live axle, meaning that our current setup has all the gears with the same layer pattern. obivously, you print gears with the teeth pointing outwards, not upwards, meaning that the layer lines are the same direction as the connection to the gear. basically, if a part get stressed, the layer lines have to deal with the stress. if they can't, it snaps. obviously, the best solution is to dump a ton of fillets. hey! fun new challenge! we should be able to get a live axle for the left (-y) side of the tool. wait, a picture would probably help!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12302025 - 1.png>)

notice anything?

yeah, so for the currently blue gear. yeah. it's sorta floating, don't you think? as in, we cant exactly fit in a fake bearing (the gear is kinda too small), so we kinda gotta get a live axle and put the bearings at the end plates. what's the best shape for a shaft thingy? probably a hexagon, probably not a circle. ok, well, lets get to it! ok, it's currently 6:45 PM, brb!

back at 7:00 PM! so how do filament gears even grab on? im assuming they're different than normal gears? pl. 7:15 PM, gonna brb!

9:49 PM and its been quite more than a "right back", but let's get to it

the one hole in the back plate does nothing, but i guess we'll just keep it around because it looks cool and probably helps with support

0.1cm (1mm) bearing must be the goofiest thing ive overlooked (if it isn't clear, making a bearing with height 0.1cm is probably not printable). thankfully, parametric cad might save the day, give it a sec. good news! since everything is so so parametric, all the changes have been updated! that might have been up there in the top 10 biggest oversights, since theres no way i was about to do 0.1cm height bearings on a 0.1cm width plate (that's gonna bend like crazy)

ok, 10:13 PM, gonna go watch a movie (yes, a dvd from the library)

anyways, back at 12:28 AM, let's just finish this, shall we?

ok, been a bit. ready to make a shell? ok, so the front facing cover needs to be THICK. and i mean, it really, really needs to keep the whole structure upright. it was set to be at 0.3cm, but i think 0.5cm will be good with some pocketing for structure, just to be safe! with my mini elevator model from the whole mini robot arc, 0.4cm doesn't flex much when applying the bend test. but 0.5cm is probably good for safety. ok, let's get to it!

mightve gotten a bit too caught up with vanity, one second

ok, so current issues are that the gearbox connection is probably wiggly wobbly and that the wind tunnel sorta doesn't even connect to the front plate.

yeah, idk what more vanity to put on the front shell, well, it's 1:00 AM now, and that's mostly it for today! oh right, i also kinda wanna actually redo the gearbox front top plate, since it's currently just a mirror. ok, good night!
