# 12/26/2025 - 23rd Update!

well, where did the morning go? idk. gonna finish this motor mount then start writing yesterday's log! goal today? finish motor mount VERY QUICKLY, then start working on the tool base and the docking bits! 2:33 PM here in NYC, music is playing, let's do this!

switching to m3 screws because it seems thats what the motor uses to mount (we dont want to spend too much on extra screws?)

not my best work, but here's the motor mount!

ok, currently 2:59 PM, gonna write the log, aim to finish in 15 minutes, then assemble in assembly, then start discussing what we want to do for the tool base! ok, 3:12 and the log is written! oh right we need to find some pulleys for this

ok, so we'll probably use some of the extra linear rod material for the vertical transmission of the motor rotation is what im thinking?

ok, [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808347934917.html) seem to work well for this, bore 12mm, 30t, width 6mm, added to the bom!

im gonna take a potato chip and eat it (how have we spent an hour looking for pulleys?)

how is regen time being so long, even the regen time is loading

wait they might need m4 screws. never mind, just noticed that shipping suddenly became $6.07, nope aint happening

[here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256809944105936.html) is a overall cheaper one since it has free shipping!

yeah, so idk how im gonna cad this clamp anymore, i guess we'll figure it out once we get the stuff? since the dimensions aren't exactly clear. ok, sudden BOM work, we need 276.4cm of linear rods in total

ok, idk what to keep doing what this (transmission shaft top bearing and bottom bearings), so im just gonna move on to the tool for now, since theres a chance we might change how we do this is the future. anyways, moving on!

self reminder that we need to cad the bearing stacks! nah, imma do that right now, one second

ok, so one of the things i have been referencing (seems to be the k1 gantry) has cf rods for the axle of the bearings, im probably just gonna use pla (checked [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804801901989.html), was $1.90 but then shipping added another $4.68, so i dont think its worth it for a bit more strength (im not even sure if that is what we're looking for lol))

ok, 12 minutes later, bearing stacks all added! ok, its 5:18 PM now, and i think its time for a quick commit, bathroom break, then start the tool base!
