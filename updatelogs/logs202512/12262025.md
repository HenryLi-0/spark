# 12/26/2025 - 23rd Update!

well, where did the morning go? idk. gonna finish this motor mount then start writing yesterday's log! goal today? finish motor mount VERY QUICKLY, then start working on the tool base and the docking bits! 2:33 PM here in NYC, music is playing, let's do this!

switching to m3 screws because it seems thats what the motor uses to mount (we dont want to spend too much on extra screws?)

not my best work, but here's the motor mount!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12262025 - 1.png>)

ok, currently 2:59 PM, gonna write the log, aim to finish in 15 minutes, then assemble in assembly, then start discussing what we want to do for the tool base! ok, 3:12 and the log is written! oh right we need to find some pulleys for this

ok, so we'll probably use some of the extra linear rod material for the vertical transmission of the motor rotation is what im thinking?

ok, [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808347934917.html) seem to work well for this, bore 12mm, 30t, width 6mm, added to the bom!

im gonna take a potato chip and eat it (how have we spent an hour looking for pulleys?)

how is regen time being so long, even the regen time is loading

wait they might need m4 screws. never mind, just noticed that shipping suddenly became $6.07, nope aint happening

[here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256809944105936.html) is a overall cheaper one since it has free shipping!

yeah, so idk how im gonna cad this clamp anymore, i guess we'll figure it out once we get the stuff? since the dimensions aren't exactly clear. ok, sudden BOM work, we need 276.4cm of linear rods in total

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12262025 - 2.png>)

ok, idk what to keep doing what this (transmission shaft top bearing and bottom bearings), so im just gonna move on to the tool for now, since theres a chance we might change how we do this is the future. anyways, moving on!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12262025 - 3.png>)

self reminder that we need to cad the bearing stacks! nah, imma do that right now, one second

ok, so one of the things i have been referencing (seems to be the k1 gantry) has cf rods for the axle of the bearings, im probably just gonna use pla (checked [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804801901989.html), was $1.90 but then shipping added another $4.68, so i dont think its worth it for a bit more strength (im not even sure if that is what we're looking for lol))

ok, 12 minutes later, bearing stacks all added! ok, its 5:18 PM now, and i think its time for a quick commit, bathroom break, then start the tool base!

hey, welcome back, its 9:18 PM now, turns out that taking a break suddenly becomes a nap and then you just get unmotivated to do anything for a while. interesting. anyways, back to discuss the tool base! obviously, it is a pretty complex geometry to deal with, but not anything that we havent seen yet, just we need to figure out and list all the parts that stay on the tool base and the parts that move with the tool!

tool base:
- gantry (obviously)
- stepper motor
    - hexagon shape (to connect)
- electronics connector
- fans
- docking

tool:
- gearing
- electronics connector
- the whole cold end to heating element to extruder stuff
- docking

uh shocking oversight, but just noticed the tool to tool base connection, well, cant be reached. what's the problem? the latch is behind, if we're looking at it from the front, the fan, which is meant to stay on the tool. problem is, both are in the best place they can be, it just doesnt work out. 

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12262025 - 4.png>)

im not sure that's good airflow.

uh oh, broke a bunch of sketches

never mind, was able to fix it! maybe its time to consider a different mounting solution? ok, ive been rolling around trying to think of a solution, and i cant think of a good one. the best i have is maybe moving a latch to the top? would leave a bunch of empty space in the middle, but that could mess with cog (eh probably fine), but it would add vertical height. and maybe a couple magnets in the middle area, but yeah, that's the best idea i have as of now. also got the idea of a triangle latch gravity based solution, but it seems to risky to actually implement (and also needs to be fast otherwise it'll just fall off the docking area, and not sure its very reliable).

or maybe turn the top latch into a two way latch???

10:21 PM now, idk, im gonna go watch a movie now!

12:12 AM, yeah, we making a double latch system. to reference the youtube mechanism guy `thang010146` and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUNgQ1GLz2Q) video with the latch, im thinking of having the springs be on the tool and the big blocks be on the tool base and the bay area. also, this design isn't stable at all, unfortunately, since, well, any push will set it loose. huh. (maybe i should just use like a random small DC motor to just control and active locking system?). idk, whatever system we have, some system of magnets is ideal here, probably. im gonna get out a whiteboard and draw some ideas

im starting to think its not possible without electromagnets? because my idea currently hopes that the magnet is able to "shift" the tool over. actually, i dont think a combined latch could work here? since, if you would need to dock twice in a dock in order for both latches to work? as in, the tool would need to shift. well, ive currently been only using springs on the tool right now, maybe i should try out springs on the tool base and bay area sides?

![wha](</updatelogs/images/202512/12262025 - 5.png>)

yeah idk anymore, those were my attempts in making a combined latch with the tool having the springs. still playing around with the other one. we somehow need to pull it off the bay, have the bay accept it, while also making it lock itself?

ok, i guess the solution here is just to keep it simple and straight forward with a small dc motor to "lock" it in place on the tool base, and a latch to keep it mounted on the side. this should allow us to have control over where we want it!

yeah, it's 1:06 AM now, pretty nice and snowy outside here in NYC! but yeah, i guess we'll start the tool tomorrow (wow already behind schedule...)

ok, good night!
