# 12/25/2025 - 22nd Update!

theres no snow in nyc right now, maybe a couple ice chunks when the snow melted and refroze from like earlier this week or last week. anyways, after a very large family gathering in someplace flushing (yeah, the streets and stores have changed A LOT over the years), here we are!

currently 5:23 PM, gonna write down a couple ideas i had today (while travelling and stuff). first, we have to fix the bearing problem, obviously, but i also find it somewhat annoying that we have a screw head sticking out. also, around 4:00 PM, for like, roughly 15 minutes, i did a bit of updating checks and stuff so that the slider is actually defined in the mastersketch! but yeah, i also want to add some clamps to this, since im fairly sure that 1.5cm or 2cm isnt much for a linear rod to use to stay straight

not sure how to add clamps for the ends, but it'll probably have to be on the side (a bit ugly in terms of asethetics, but there isnt really much space there). maybe modifying it a bit so that its part of the structure itself, but that also would affect structure, so idk

simulation loading something

i mean not bad, the sim is assuming 10 pounds of force (which isnt the case) at the end (which isnt the case) of a single rod (which isnt the case) of a cantilever (which isnt the case) rod

i dont know why cadding is going a bit slower today (just remembered we havent done yesteray's journal yet), but currently in the middle of redoing parts of the x slider so that it, well, does its job

oh yeah, i guess we're not gonna put clamps just yet, since it might not be needed!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12252025 - 2.png>)

and yeah, changed that geometry, made the bearings able to actually be physically added, then changed the screw thing so that it can actually be cased in on the sides!

ok, was in the middle of adding the support brackets, and im thinking that these motors should be mounted higher, since, well, it would save on this extra box tubing (which is kinda unnecessary here), since it can be mounted to the bottom of the tsr extrusion (top layer, side section, right one). i mean, it does bring it a bit close to the bottom of the docking bay area, but we could always just put the three extruders in the middle and the interesting ones on the side (they will likely not require a heated element)

speaking of heating elements, the other day i had another idea! since we only ever need one heating element per extruder (that needs it, of course), we don't need all hotends to have an electrical connection at once. therefore, some pogo pin setup of sorts to make it so that, when docking, the heater of the active extruder can connect and do its thing! unforunately, pogo pins are mighty expensive for some reason, so i did consider dupont connectors or something similar, but i need to check the amp ratings real quick. obviously, both these ideas dont really have decent amp ratings, at least for the heating element. what's a good answer? anderson connectors, probably (the small ones). yeah, anderson powerpole, we have those in robotics, they probably work well for alignement and all.

also, a couple days ago, i dont remember when, i did motherboard research (i decided that we are definitely NOT doing custom motherboard), the [skr 1.4 turbo](https://www.zyltech.com/genuine-skr-1-4-turbo-3d-printer-control-board-by-bigtree-tech/) (or normal) both seem good, pretty cheap, not too shabby specs (i think?) and should offer enough ports and stuff (yes, it only has 3 heating connections, which isn't enough, but the proposed solution was explained in the paragraph before this one!)

anyways, where was i? oh right, half an hour change of topic, time to consider the motor mounting situation!

so 7:45 PM, idk, im gonna head off to dinner! when i come back i should probably write yesterday's log, then get back to it, but im gonna spend some time thinking about it!

back at 8:41 PM, shocking news, i didnt think about it between this time because its probably healthy to take breaks. anyways, to writing yesterday's log!

8:52 PM and done writing that! ok, time to face if we need that extrusion. ok, the dice says to not keep it. now, do i agree with the dice? well, sure, it's not necessary, so i guess yeah, i agree with the dice. of course, we will need the mmm (middle layer, middle part, middle one) extrusion, so we're keeping that. also, we dont actually need to worry too much about moving it up, because we can use the mmm extrusion for support!

did a bit of searching, the motherboard and power supply should be able to fit nicely inside the electronics space! anyways, back to cad! ok, theres no more msr (middle layer, side part, right one) extrusion!

oh right, i wanted to lay out the roadmap to finish this project!

- 12/25/2025: Finish CoreXY
    - Finish the CoreXY parts (mainly the sliders)
- 12/26/2025: Start Tool Area
    - Finish the tool base
    - Work on docking bits, move parts if needed 
- 12/27/2025: Finish Tool Area
    - Finish the tool (extruder)
    - CFD on the part cooling if time allows, otherwise can do later
    - Ensure no collisions between tool and tool base
- 12/28/2025: Complete Docking Bay and Check Collisions
    - Finish docking bay
    - Overall CAD Full Assembly (shouldnt be hard at all)
    - Overall CAD check for any impossible actions or major issues
- 12/29/2025: Electronics and Firmware
    - Wiring check and making sure we are rated properly
    - Firmware review (klipper) and check that everything is compatible
    - Start work on BOM if time allows
- 12/30/2025: BOM and Ship
    - Finish adding everything to the BOM
    - Reduce BOM, remove some parts if needed
    - Final check and ship, ok if pushed to tomorrow
- 12/31/2025: Buffer day
    - Final day for work, ideally only shipping should be pushed here

and yeah! that's the plan! so corexy today! back to finally working on the motor mount!

yeah this ones gonna be a weird one to design

corners of corners final boss

anyways, not sure about the tsf or tsr side mounts since the triangles are facing downwards for easier assembly (since, youll probably assemble the frame, the put on the top, then the corexy on top, then the most top layer extrusions). however, if its flipped for support, theres not much material grabbing onto the actual triangle themselves (unless you use an allen key i guess, but still). hopefully the material blocks should help, though they probably wont do much. well, the most they'll do is just help with any vibrations by not allowing the plate flex upwards (but gravity is downwards, so idk). the plate is currently 0.5cm thick, which is pretty thick, given the fact that most of `raven`'s parts are 0.3cm thick (yes, got a caliper to make sure!) (no, i didnt remember that one, unfortunately). additionally, the plate will be forced to be pulled (well, pla does deform over time), so that should also help.

this might be top 10 most cursed mounting ive done, totally forget that the motor is partially in the tsf side of the mount (the two screws for that side are inside that section)

ok, 10:27 PM, its movie time

ok 12:23 AM and we're back! yes, it was a christmas themed movie (elf), but yeah, motor mount! solution: don't think about it for now. ok, three minutes later, turns out you can't ignore the problem right in front of you. huh.

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12252025 - 4.png>)

bit of progress, not much fillets yet, but i think i have an idea of where to go from here! just realized theres no need for screw holes where i though i needed some so that's neat. wait why isnt the tsr side just a giant corridor (gd reference???), wait we only need lower screw holes on the mmm side... hmm it might smarter to just put an upwards corner here, since we're currently only holding ourselves up with sideways mounts and the top of the mmm side...

yeah it might make more sense to just make it so that you have to screw it in from the bottom, in terms of layers supporting each other, yes, it is possible it could break, but i haven't really had anything snap from layer lines, at least with large plane area

mfw something about a non manifold body. anyways, i guess we'll connect those two bits, but for now, im gonna head off to bed!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12252025 - 5.png>)

should be staying at home tomorrow so yeah, hopefully gonna finish this before noon, then start the tool stuff in the afternoon and evening! ok, wow, its 1:06 AM huh. ok, good night!
