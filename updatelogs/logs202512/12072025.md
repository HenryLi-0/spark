# 12/7/2025 - 18th Update!

oh

yeah, we're really running out of time. yeah, its decemeber already, and a whole week has once again passed without touching this. unfortunately, this week was ridicious because of the amount of homework given by a certain teacher (ap language cough cough), along with the big big important test with three letters in its name, thats also the past tense of sitting down. yeah, that was today, idk how i felt. also, its actually 12:30 AM, 12/7/2025, i just wanted to get working right away

SO, changes to be made. gonna try to shift to a daily journal update on the blueprint side, since the current setup is VERY messy and is basically a mess left over by `raven`. yes, i do plan to get that done by the holidays, when all these classes finish giving all their exams within a week of each other (seriously, not all at once please!).

so what's to be done today? or, well, (orwell? like 1984?) when i wake up? here's the todo list for today:
- update past logs onto the blueprint journal page (this will not be super fun)
- work on BOM

that's right! today is bom day, to some extent. simply, right now, we have NO idea how much budget is left (if there is budget left, uh oh). therefore, we gotta try to keep everything under $400, since thats also sorta the point of this project (to also have a cheap open source model). if there are sacrifices that need to be made, im willing to sacrifice build space, extra upper structure, and enclosure (this one was super far fetched anyway), and maybe even motherboard (this means custom, jlcpcb please be nice)

so yeah, that's the plan for today, aka, when i wake up. if time allows, continuing work on the linear rails and pulley system for the xy area is probably the best move, with extruder geometry following, and then everything from then on should be more straightforward.

so yeah! 12:39 AM now, see you in the morning!

yeah, ok, 3:34 PM now, gotta start jorunaling! (as in, updaitng that journal)

- 11/22/2025 - 1.75 hr
- 11/23/2025 - 0.25 hr
- 11/28/2025 - 3.25 hr
- 11/29/2025 - 3.75 hr
- sum - 9 hrs

huh, looking back, ive noticed that for nine circles on gd i got to 18% on 11/29/2025, well, im at 50% now (as of like two days ago, didnt play much today or yesterday)

ok, been a bit, wrote the journal! idk how the journal updating works anymore, since the blueprint bot thing didnt update the repository? idk, well, BOM work time! (on spreadsheets, of course)

ok, all measurements taken and put in, now i just need some rates (as in, a source and a price)

so we need, uh, a total of 514 cm of aluminum extrusion, 170 for the base, 140 for the middle area, 60 for the motor/electronics area, and 144 for the top, so thats 5140 mm. ouch. wait, im gonna add another spreadsheet to define machine dimensions so that adding new things are easier. also, i just realized i forgot to add the z axis extrusions. oops. yeah, that bumps it to 631.8 cm. ok, changed it so that it references previous stuff in the spreadsheet so it auto updates everything that should be equal! (so its not a seperate spreadsheet)

hmm amazon seems to have some not bad deals, [4pc 1220mm](https://www.amazon.com/Aluminum-Extrusion-European-Standard-Anodized/dp/B0CLGXN1D8/) is 4880mm for $40, with is $0.082 per cm, which is pretty decent.

![uhh](</updatelogs/images/202512/12072025 - 1.png>)

ouch jlcmc, yes, its cheap, but this shipping is INSANE (most of the price probably gets factored into there, yes, that's the cheapest option). this probably leaves us with amazon and their free shipping terms

ok, im considering dropping to top layer, which would drop 144cm off. im fine getting a saw or something to slice it (probably could find one in the garage, probably wouldnt bring super long aluminum extrusions to bronx science, besides, it'll be kickoff by then, meaning itll be busy anyways). next stop, infill! what for? to find aluminum extrusion places to buy from (hopefully cheaper deals please?)

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12072025 - 2.png>)

ok aliexpress, let's not get a little too crazy (see the discover more list). haha. ha. ha. these allegations, no way right. (im assuming no one reads this, but i found this a bit funny. now how is aliexpress stalking my internet activities.) anyways, point is, we're hopping over to the aliexpress site for extrusions! [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802466647592.html) seems pretty good, as of now, since the christmas sale seems to start tomorrow, with a $0.064 per cm (at least for 600mm rates). only downside is that it will take forever to ship, probably. also, thanks to [daedelus from infill](https://infill.hackclub.com/printers/daedelus/) for [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832734727536.html) GT2 belts, crazy cheap.

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12072025 - 3.png>)

ok, so that's the frame, should be roughly $22.01, if we use aliexpress! gonna remove the rate based one since we're gonna have to round up for this (because, as much as i would like, i cant find a smooth way to cut multiple 30cm extrusions out of 45cm, dont worry, we are adding the 34 and 6 together, but that still leaves 5cm). we're just gonna be buying the most at the cheapest we can ($0.99 with the deals)

just kidding, i got trolled, one sec as i fix the spreadsheets

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202512/12072025 - 4.png>)

ok, that should be more correct?

more organizing, working on coreXY, gonna actually switch out all aliexpress prices to their non-deal prices, since idk if this christmas deal applies to everything, and we want to stay safe anyways

yeah this might be a scam at $0.26 per cm, seems like the christmas sale only applies to one object in the cart? we're trying to be $0.25 per cm, which is the mcmaster carr price

back to amazon

[this](https://www.amazon.com/Aluminum-Extrusion-European-Standard-15-75inch/dp/B08Y8N7FD1/) is $0.11 per cm, did a bit of math, $92 total

wait a second [this amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Extrusion-High-Strength-Anodizing-Technology/dp/B0CLHVSZFP/) is INSANE if true, this is twice the amount i need, but $0.066 per cm is pretty good. however, that's a bit excessive lol

going back to [the azmazon thing](https://www.amazon.com/Aluminum-Extrusion-European-Standard-Anodized/dp/B0CLGXN1D8/) at the start of this, this ones $0.075, and the 8x100cm one fits nicely, while also being decent ($60 for everything)

ok, yeah, its 1:34 AM, didnt get to work on this, good night!
