# 12/21/2025 - 20th Update!

3:31 PM on sunday! (yes, we're working on sunday now too!) i was about to jump straight into work when i remembered our new update schedule, yeah, lets head on over to the site

3:51 PM and that was quite a log to read through and write up! but yeah, time to hop back into the cad!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12212025 - 1.png>)

something like this?

instead of doing the "plus shaped" structure that was used for the -x direction, im probably gonna keep this 4 pointed? (looking back, that was originally just gonna be support for the axle, but it kinda doesnt really do anything?) i guess with alignment, maybe, but there isnt really much advantage?

yeah, looking at it its kinda not necessary, it was mostly just larger so the bearings could fit in, but there isnt really a clear reason why the axle holding parts are just thinner

but yeah, besides the point for now, gonna get working! 4:15 PM and im gonna go help setup a camera real quick!

back at 5:07 PM, quite an interesting setup! anyways, for the cad, i think a downwards slice is probably the way to go for this one

slice slice slice

anyways, lower bits done! i guess time to add the upper bits? not much to modify, i guess making that the left one more solide, but the second one doesnt need to be modified, but the cut outs are still needed!

working on it, updated the estimated pulley size (as in, the one on the motor) to 1.5cm in daimeter, not sure what the actual one will be since i havent found it yet, had to move the motor a bit closer to the docking area, shaft should still clear the area, but just a note. wait a second, the belt doesnt clear the area, gonna fix that

![woo](</updatelogs/images/202512/12212025 - 3.png>)

6:16 PM and the upper bits are done now! ok, that's pretty good! now comes, yeah. the corners of the corners, as in, the screw areas.

yeah i tried mirroring it but that didnt really end well, so i guess we're modifying those sketches yet again!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12212025 - 4.png>)

and its done! (well, for now) oh right, cool thing, was able to do all the sketches and extrudes with the stuff we already had, so no new features were used for adding more corners of the corners!

and that's the frame! (do motor mounts go here? eh, thats pretty easy to make)

so yeah! 6:55 PM, gonna commit here, gonna take a shower, eat dinner, then probably continue working on this, then end the night with homework (should have enough time). ok, here's a commit!
