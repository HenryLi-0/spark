# 12/20/2025 - 19th Update!

hey im back, ya miss me?

so it seems like i already started working on this, but in my dream last night. but that's besides the point, i wrote that thing above in my dream and now you're gonna read it. 10:00 AM here in NYC, chilly morning, and its been basically 2 weeks since the last update.

very little work happened through that time, so ill just list what happened:

- 12/8/2025, during apcs (study hall that day) for motor controller
- 12/11/2025 1:15 AM for bom, end 1:56 AM

so, lets keep the update cycle and write last times log over on blueprint real quick

ok, 10:10 AM, log written, and i think i remember where i left off here. so where have i been? decemeber sat happened the day before the last log, act happened last week (i did all the act stuff in two days, as in, i did all my learning on saturday and took the test on sunday), so yeah, last night (friday) was mostly me being tired, so we're now back on a free weekend! then theres two days of school, gonna be busy delivering gifts, and then its winter break, which will be grind time!

so what do we need to do? here's the todo!

TODO:
- work on BOM
- work on XY pulleys and motion system
- work on extruder geometry

yeah, also, during this extended hiatus, i did realize there are free things out there to analyze the airflow, so we'll do that in a bit! thing is now, we should probably get working on the motion system! let me get some music on (currently, in terms of BOM, its nearing $240, with most of the major expensive stuff, so i think we're still safe here?)

oh yeah, im definitely sick today which is really annoying. gonna have to go to the doctor's at like 5 PM or 6 PM today. anyways, while my nose and throat hurt, let's pull up some music and get cadding!

im not exactly sure how we put a pulley inside a solid thing. ok, modified the side heights so the linear rods are closer to the tops (they honestly dont need much to even keep them together) and more spacing between the belt and top of the linear rod (hopefully this should make us able to add some form of axle to make it actually spin) (theres currently 1.725cm between the top of the linear rod and the bottom of the expected belt area)

now, how do we put the pulley inside? probably some slide in screw in solution

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 1.png>)

simpily, one side gone, one side slide in, and then "some" method of alignment (i guess so groves on the top and bottom?) and "some" method of locking (without superglue, since you should be able to take it off) (maybe some clamping system on the top and bottom?), then you thread the belt through, hopefully comes out the other end, then that should also keep it aligned a bit? (it'll pull on it so its more pushing on the material, but itll want to be a straight line or else its pulling it towards the side since the belt would then be misaligned so basically it can self center to some extent?)

anyways, time to implement this! just realized we still need to figure out how to mount this

sidequest, tried fixing the messed up part cooling fan, doesnt seem to be working, oops too bad

11:11 AM, gonna go to the bathroom real quick, 11:19 AM and back!

im not sure why walmart sells `F623-2RS-BEARING STACK` but ok, we need 24 of those

ok, not sure why im trying to modify whats already here to make it work, but i really cant think with that, so guess we're deleting it! (even though, we do kinda need this to work on it, whatever)

nvm, lets undo that, wow this is really hard to design well

12:12 PM, gonna take a quick break to do something else, but the structure seems to be good for it!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 3.png>)

12:38 PM and back!

isn't it gonna be wiggly wobbly with that setup? yes, next question. (in all seriousness, it was shaky from the beginning, gonna print the two in different directions just to make it at least a bit less shaky?) anyways, gonna work on the corner thing, also, we need to find linear bearings, also, the distance between some bits can be decreased, getting to it now

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 4.png>)

yeah, super shiny, but we got a little corner thing! kinda worried about how to print this thing, but yeah, we gotta do this little traingle thing in 4 more places!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 5.png>)

and there it is! now, we gotta work on the 90 degrees ones (aaaaa)

ok, 2:15 PM now, off to lunch! quick commit!

ok, 3:15 PM, back from doing other stuff!

updated the belts so that we dont need an extra set of pulleys (pulley tensioner could probably be done with this setup still), thinking of making the +x -y and +x +y ones (we were working on the -x -y and -x +y previously) big and solid, since we need to integrate the motor turning stuff in anyways

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 6.png>)

(this is old on the left, new on the right)

looking over this, wondering about collisions between the stepper motors and the "big future todo pulley setup"?

![woo](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 7.png>)

this is why i love parametric cad lol

anyways, we should have a good amount of space to work with!

hmm wondering about how to do this in a non messy way, since the interactions are, similarly to the +x side, has like inverted upside down similarity.

3:45 PM and brb, back at 4:09 PM! i dont really have an idea how to do this, still thinking about it

wondering if i should go for a massive plate style thing or a corner mostly air thing?

probably gonna do this in layers, reflect, and transform up/down the halves, then boolean them together?

orm 4:30 PM, time to go to the doctor's now!

ok, its 4:50 PM now, turns out we're not going to the doctor since theyre full. ok, at least that time spent in the bathroom gave a couple ideas!

wait lemme find a pulley

mfw $0.72 pulley on jlcmc becomes $3.84 because of shipping, we're gonna have to find someway to move the motor rotation to the actual pulley...

also, not too important, but we also have to make the motor mounts in a bit, but once we figure that out, the frame should be ready, so we can move on the the coreXY itself in a bit (as in, the belts, the rods, etc.)

you know what, imma stop thinking and just throw myself at it, we'll figure out the nuances as we go

this is pretty badly optimized for regen times isnt it? because we have a lot of repeating stuff, oh well

what, hopefully you didnt think i was gonna leave it unoptimized right? jut noticed, look at the id number of the images from this commit (or, since lunch), ok, enough goofing around

5:30 PM and im getting a bit tired, ill be back at 6 PM ish?

spoiler alert, back at 12:02 AM, not sure how to do these 90 degree belts since if they are "outer", so if i cant add the slide bit in the center (else it just pulls the whole thing inwards), but outwards also isnt very supported. (also, the change with the diagonal for the corner to save on bearings also doesnt really help, since we'll have to have an angle with one of the belts)

anyways, been a bit, here's my idea?

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 8.png>)

the shaded area is the solid-ish parts, so lemme just write down my thoughts

the motor spinning bit is providing the most amount of rotation power (well, its the only source), so when we spin clockwise, the left setup gets pulled on, and that pulls the block towards +y, while if we spin counterclockwise, it supplies the left setup with extra pulley which also gets pulled towards -x since the whole gantry and stuff is moving, and this is similar behavior for the right setup, as in pushing and pulling, so this just means we have to be able to lock the block in place... or do we? you see, if we slope the blocks so that its slanted and pointed, its harder for any deviations in printing to cause it to shift enough across the +x or -y to escape the whole setup! of course, we slant it "inwards" as in, the angle decreases. if it were to increase, the force would be forced to the side which, you know, causes the thing to possibly pop off, so the slanted setup is the way to go! now, when you talk about vertical structure, idk what to tell you lol, i guess the giant block and the auto self centering should be enough?

wait whats stopping me from compact it even more by making that pulley go sideways

ok, now the pulley (the left one in the previous picture) has its center vertical to the center of the motor pulley! this makes it much more compact, but it gives me much more nightmare to make this all mesh together.

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 9.png>)

ok, 1:11 AM and we got the base done now! yes, these seem to be very good opportunities to place vanity art/text on the outside flat areas! so i guess tomorrow will be me trying to add the bearing slide in and stuff, since, well, you cant add bearings or axles for them in this design right now!

but yeah, that's it for today! been quite a day with the one part, i guess we'll finish the motor side tomorrow, and (hopefully) start the coreXY setup (this should be easier, just linear bearings and some thing to connect to the Y rods), and maybe maybe maybe start working on the base of the extruder area?

so yeah, nice to be back, 11 days left to work on this! let's just say 9 so that we finish a bit early, since we dont want to run out of time, and we need time to check anyways. ok, it just turned 1:15 AM, so good night!
