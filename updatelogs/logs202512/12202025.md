# 12/20/2025 - 19th Update

hey im back, ya miss me?

so it seems like i already started working on this, but in my dream last night. but that's besides the point, i wrote that thing above in my dream and now you're gonna read it. 10:00 AM here in NYC, chilly morning, and its been basically 2 weeks since the last update.

very little work happened through that time, so ill just list what happened:

- 12/8/2025, during apcs (study hall that day) for motor controller
- 12/11/2025 1:15 AM for bom, end 1:56 AM

so, lets keep the update cycle and write last times log over on blueprint real quick

ok, 10:10 AM, log written, and i think i remember where i left off here. so where have i been? decemeber sat happened the day before the last log, act happened last week (i did all the act stuff in two days, as in, i did all my learning on saturday and took the test on sunday), so yeah, last night (friday) was mostly me being tired, so we're now back on a free weekend! then theres two days of school, gonna be busy delivering gifts, and then its winter break, which will be grind time!

so what do we need to do? here's the todo!

TODO:
- work on BOM
- work on XY pulleys and motion system
- work on extruder geometry

yeah, also, during this extended hiatus, i did realize there are free things out there to analyze the airflow, so we'll do that in a bit! thing is now, we should probably get working on the motion system! let me get some music on (currently, in terms of BOM, its nearing $240, with most of the major expensive stuff, so i think we're still safe here?)

oh yeah, im definitely sick today which is really annoying. gonna have to go to the doctor's at like 5 PM or 6 PM today. anyways, while my nose and throat hurt, let's pull up some music and get cadding!

im not exactly sure how we put a pulley inside a solid thing. ok, modified the side heights so the linear rods are closer to the tops (they honestly dont need much to even keep them together) and more spacing between the belt and top of the linear rod (hopefully this should make us able to add some form of axle to make it actually spin) (theres currently 1.725cm between the top of the linear rod and the bottom of the expected belt area)

now, how do we put the pulley inside? probably some slide in screw in solution

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 1.png>)

simpily, one side gone, one side slide in, and then "some" method of alignment (i guess so groves on the top and bottom?) and "some" method of locking (without superglue, since you should be able to take it off) (maybe some clamping system on the top and bottom?), then you thread the belt through, hopefully comes out the other end, then that should also keep it aligned a bit? (it'll pull on it so its more pushing on the material, but itll want to be a straight line or else its pulling it towards the side since the belt would then be misaligned so basically it can self center to some extent?)

anyways, time to implement this! just realized we still need to figure out how to mount this

sidequest, tried fixing the messed up part cooling fan, doesnt seem to be working, oops too bad

11:11 AM, gonna go to the bathroom real quick, 11:19 AM and back!

im not sure why walmart sells `F623-2RS-BEARING STACK` but ok, we need 24 of those

ok, not sure why im trying to modify whats already here to make it work, but i really cant think with that, so guess we're deleting it! (even though, we do kinda need this to work on it, whatever)

nvm, lets undo that, wow this is really hard to design well

12:12 PM, gonna take a quick break to do something else, but the structure seems to be good for it!

12:38 PM and back!

isn't it gonna be wiggly wobbly with that setup? yes, next question. (in all seriousness, it was shaky from the beginning, gonna print the two in different directions just to make it at least a bit less shaky?) anyways, gonna work on the corner thing, also, we need to find linear bearings, also, the distance between some bits can be decreased, getting to it now

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 4.png>)

yeah, super shiny, but we got a little corner thing! kinda worried about how to print this thing, but yeah, we gotta do this little traingle thing in 4 more places!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12202025 - 5.png>)

and there it is! now, we gotta work on the 90 degrees ones (aaaaa)

ok, 2:15 PM now, off to lunch! quick commit!
