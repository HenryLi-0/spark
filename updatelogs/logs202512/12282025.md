# 12/28/2025 - 25th Update!

yeah time is running out! those words seem familiar...

4:02 PM today and i should have the rest of today to work, of course, ignoring dinner and all. i still am worried about the cad shape, so guess what we're doing? yep, gonna model it in minecraft. yes, i know, it's not exactly the best parametric blah blah, i just want to visualize it better

ok, its 5:14 PM now, finished it in mc!

since minecraft doesnt exactly have a section view, the structure block is the best you can get with it!

so yeah, i think i have a better idea of what goes where, so we need to make sure that the gearing of the filament pulling doesn't go behind the latches. im still stuck with the question if the gearing stages so stay attached to the tool base or be part of every tool? im leaning towards part of every tool since it allows us to do the docking thing, but it's also less precise at the end of the day (well, not necessarily, since directly going stepper motor to a connection is probably better than stages if there is a lot of backlash) (just played around with my pla swerve module recreation, and it seems like PLA doesnt have too much backlash)

quick break down of the picutre:
- grey glass and grey concrete: stepper motor stator
- andesite: stepper motor rotor
- orange concrete and orange glass: fan
- spruce and varients: base slider (y slider)
- yellow glass: some rotor to gearing connection
- bamboo planks: gearing to rotor connection
- cherry and varients: gearing
- quartz: filament grabbing wheels
- clear glass: tool shell
- brown glass: part of base slider
- cobblestone: cold end 
- mangrove and varients: cold end cooling
- pale oak and varients: cool end cooling air flow
- sandstone: heater
- red sandstone: extruder
- warped and varients and prismarine: latch

and i guess the motor for mechanical locking with go on the top, and the magnets will be at the corners of the y slider?

ok, enough of this, lets get cadding! gonna clean up what we have so far and then get to it!

gotta fix this gearing... ok, so its been quite a bit, changed it to a 14:28, then another 14:28, just to make sure it fits between the latch areas. we will need a bit of a plate there and blah but yeah, im gonna export the 14 gear and see how it prints real quick (oh right, we're using 32 dp by the way), using a 0.20mm strength profile with inland filament (pla+)

ok, it seems my printer is make to make such gears! nice, ok, im gonna print another one to make sure they mesh, this time the 28 one

ok, 7:00 PM, off to dinner!

ok, 9:21 PM, speaking of nine, just did 39%-80% of nine circles in a copy (starting position at 39%), aiming for pretty consistent wave before attempting to do the whole thing! anyways, back to the gears! 

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12282025 - 4.png>)

they mesh very well! tried agressively fighting one, the teeth didnt suddenly pop off so thats good! in fact, as i type this, ive been swinging the gear teeth violently towards each other, and they're not exploding or breaking, in fact, there doesnt seem to be any chipping at all? there aren't any axles yet, so i cant clearly test it, but there doesnt seem to be any backlash?

9:30 PM, gonna take a break, 9:45 PM and back, idk what to even do at this point, i think im gonna work on the gearing, just kidding, that's technically part of the tool, i guess fan mounts, gonna change some fan location to be a bit closer to the inside since this setup doesnt have space to screw stuff in

10:24 PM and got the connection thing there, kinda sucks imo but we just need to get this done, the gearing is also messed up, also idk how how to even screw that in, we'll need a gearbox in the back or something, gonna go off to watch a movie now, idk how to do this

ok 12:31 AM, its gonna be a very busy two days. uh. lemme check if its extended... nope it isn't, oh dear, i guess i gotta wake up earlier tomorrow. ok, set up five alarms, this should hopefully do it, ive never set my alarm audio this loud before... ok, good night!
