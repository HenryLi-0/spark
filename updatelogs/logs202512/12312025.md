# 12/31/2025 - 28th Update!

well! that's a year! last day of 2025, and starting this log at 5:30 PM. i was trying to be productive and placed homework as todo first, but ended up on gd for a good 2.5 hours. anyways, better late than never! also, yeah, i finished my math homework after reviewing a bit! anyways, we probably want to write a log quickly first, right?

ok, finished writing that, back to work!

hmm i think it might be too much pocketing that it starts looking bad, but idk

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12312025 - 1.png>)

yeah, not a lot of writing today, but here's the plan. you see those two extra mounting holes there? what are they for? well, they're for some brackets that will also be connected to the shaft collar type stuff going on with the heatsink (it's still called a clamp in cad, but that probably still conveys the idea). meanwhile, idk how we're gonna connect the latches.

ok, made spaces for the latches, it doesn't quite have the same charm, but that's alright. ok, 7:30 PM, brb!

9:47 PM and back! how to make latch... time to get out the whiteboard

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12312025 - 2.png>)

blueprints there... time to get cadding! (see what i did there? ok) but wait, here's what im thinking about mounting so far. first, for the latches, we'll have part of it span across the gearbox top front plate and the tool shell, which has two points for the screws to mount it. then, the top of the latches will have screws for the gearbox to attach to. also, you know what i just realized? since the latches are part of the tool base itself (we're using mechanical latches for that, right?) then the whole thing was meant to come off anyways and we didnt have to avoid it. huh. anyways, we'll also have some brackets to also secure the v6 extruder stuff, and im considering another mounting place from the air tunnel to the front shell, but idk, was planning on putting some art there. 

ok, surprise idea! what if we have the latches between the tool and tool base (so the tool base has the sticking out thing and the tool has the springs), and it acts sorta reverse, and there be magnets on the tool, along with a tunnel on the top so that it can sit at the bay area? i mean, thats better than magnets on the tool and tool base? or we can of course put the spring side of the latch on the tool base and add some springs to the back of the spring side, since we do what it to be kept in that "in between" area. however, having this setup does rely on the hope that it actually, you know, doesn't move, since the up down springs are the only things trying to stop it from falling out. maybe the reverse setup is better, with the magnets and long guide on the tool base and tool connection?

ok, so here's the deal:

- tool base: magnets and guide rail
- tool: magnets and guide (which goes into the guide rail) and latch
- bay: other side of the latch and another guide

ok, so its 10:41 PM, gonna go watch a movie, see ya!

ok, 12:25 AM, it's a new year (haha get it just kidding theres nothing funny there), but cad still continues. unfortunately, a side thing with it being midnight of the new year, there's fireworks outside. and i am very close to the window so yeah. anyways, where to put this...

not sure if putting the guide (as in, the triangle that sticks out) on the tool or on the tool and bay is the better choice. i mean, if we have it on the tool, it means we got a giant triangle sticking out on the top, so i think putting the guide rail on the top is the smarter choice?

now, to put the spring side of the latch on the tool or bay, which is better? i mean, probably gonna put the spring side on the tool or else we'll have to somehow get the middle part? well, not necessarily, since we can have guide rails too (needed anyways), and idk, but we know the mounting will be rectangular for the tool side, as in, the stuff will enter it, not the other way round. whatever we do, we'll have that mounting there, and that up there, and there and there, ok

wait hold up it needs a T shape doesnt it... also, theres no way internet has gotten this expensive, im getting an ad right now, what do you mean by "just". wait what.

oopsie i messed up which was which

hey want to hear something brilliant? yeah, i forgot thats where the filament goes in from. the top. i mean, a cutout on the top isn't that bad i guess?

i dont think onshape likes 114 features in one part studio (there is insane lag going on) (9.27s regen time is crazy)

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202512/12312025 - 3.png>)

yeah, that's what we have so far! no filament hole just yet, i guess the filament hole is also a good way to keep it from moving, just worried about it being scraped by the connection piece? hmm at the end of this, my guess is that the tool area part studio will have 14s regen time, and maybe 150 to 160 features? since we still have the brackets and all the spacer stuff to do, along with the filament grabbing, along with the part cooling tunnel (not the wind tunnel (wait have i been calling it air tunnel this entire time))

ok, updated that, took a visit to hackatime to see that, as far as it has tracked, we have spent 71 hours and 44 minutes and 45 seconds on spark! hold on a second is that the vscode or the cad... i actually dont know. maybe both? idk, but it's 1:52 AM now, so good night! oh right, last log for 2025! see you in 2026! even though it's 2026 already here in NYC! ok, good night!
