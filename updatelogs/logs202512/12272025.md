# 12/27/2025 - 24th Update!

ok, 4:01 PM today in NYC, visited the library and built a snowman thing this morning! anyways, gotta finish all the stuff about the tool base and tool today! (ouch)

anyways, time to write a journal over on the blueprint website! i actually sat down to start at 3:01 PM but idk where the last hour went. anyways, 4:14 PM, finished writing that thing, let's lay out the timings for today so i stay on track (back on track? gd reference???)

todo today:
- Finish the tool base
- Work on docking bits, move parts if needed 
- Finish the tool (extruder)
- CFD on the part cooling if time allows, otherwise can do later
- Ensure no collisions between tool and tool base

quite the list! (taken from 12/25/2025's log) gonna now write down some goals

- 4:20 PM - 5:30 PM : Finish the tool base
- 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM : Work on docking bits, move parts if needed 
- 6:00 PM - 6:15 PM : Buffer time
- 6:15 PM - 7:30 PM : shower + estimated dinner
- 7:30 PM - 8:15 PM : Finish the tool (extruder)
- 8:15 PM - 9:15 PM : CFD on the part cooling if time allows, otherwise can do later
- 9:15 PM - 9:45 PM : Ensure no collisions between tool and tool base
- 9:45 PM - ?:?? PM : Buffer time

ok, here we go!!!

breaking changes!!!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202512/12272025 - 1.png>)

if it isn't clear, changes a lot of the heights! the most notable thing, other than i only had to fix a single sketch, is that the entire tool base can partially peek outside of the "inside of the frame" and actually go into the frame area! this should be more efficient use of space, along with making the top of the frame (not including the corexy area) the max z height of whatever print bed goes there!

ok, back to working on the tool base, oh right, changed the size so that the bearings can actually go there, and changed the x slider to use this height in the cad, so we're more parametric!

ok, still at work with it, but here's the progress so far

so what is this? just checking if a M3 screw would interfere with the linear bearing (speaking of which, we should cad that), trying to make the middle as solid as possible, since this part should NOT move at ALL. also, we need to cad the belt grabby thingies

3010 fan cad time, finished fan cad, back to working on the tool base! currently working on the airflow for the part cooling, this will take a while.

6:00 PM, no we are not done with tool base, im gonna take a break for a bit.

anyways, its 2:00 AM now, i guess tomorrow will be busy. honestly, today was kinda a lot to try to do in one go, which probably scared some bit of me, but i guess today was a good day to rest for a bit, since we're nearing the final but longest stretch of work. only three days left to work on this, which isnt much time, but i think its doable if i lock in these next three days. idk, it is still a lot to do and fix. but yeah, that's gonna be it for me today, hopefully with more stuff tomorrow! ok, good night!
