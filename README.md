henry once again attempts to try something weird

(temp readme)

basically
- hackclub's general hardware ysws blueprint has appeared, nicely timed
- i dont feel like ive been doing what i usually do recently (that is the coding + cad stuff)
- the lack of frc is showing (when is build season when is build season aaaaa)

making me feel
- crazy unproductive
- really wanting something technical to work on (notably outside my comfort zone)
- really unsatisfied with how unmotivated i am nowadays

so, in response
- heres a pretty complicated project with a suspiciously close deadline

also, having a cnc mill in your bedroom seems like a pretty good idea
