## 10/13/2025 - Writing The Idea and Setting Project Scope!  

Today was generally just a super long write up of my idea/concept for what I want to make! Simply, I want to create something that enables the ability to create more, similarly to a 3D printer. However, if you have one CNC machine, why not have it able to do many CNC things at once? As in, if it can do additive manufacturing, why not subtractive manufacturing? With the ability to move objects? Basically, a 3D frame with a coreXY motion system with toolheads that can be changed. And yeah, the write up just has way more detail and stuff, check it out at [on the repo!](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/spark/blob/main/updatelogs/logs202510/10122025.md). (if i ever change this, just check for an `updatelogs` folder and navigate to today, 10/12/2025 (yes i know it's 1:37 AM on 10/13/2025 for me))

Anyways, this project is meant to challenge me to do something a bit outside my usual comfort zone! It's also to make me actually have something to work on and have fun building (since I've just been unmotivated and waiting for FRC build season the motivate me again at this point). So yeah, what better way than with programming, mechanical, and electrical!

## 10/20/2025 - Lots o' Research!  

It's been a week! Let's cut to the chase!

Simply, for the past week, I've been watching a bunch of videos, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qub5chyIQ0s) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbo6soXn_kQ) from Dr. D-Flo on YouTube. These videos were pretty entertaining and informative! Basically, watching these (and a couple other videos) helped me get some terminology, understand what I need to do, and know what things to look into. 

Moving on, also started working on deciding how to keep the budget low while also having a sturdy and decent machine. Oh yeah, also shrank the project scope a bit. The idea was, a CNC mill and 3D printer in one would be really cool, but the priority of this project is to make a printer now. I'll keep the CNC mill in the back of my mind to make it easy to implement, but for now, 3D printer first.

After this, I wrote up some stuff about keeping power usage low, then started building an image of it in Minecraft, to realize I don't like how non-parametric it is. Anyways, after that, laid out a plan for the next couple weeks! This week's plan is, well, planning. Basically, state the specifics of things. Goal's to finish by mid-November! Anyways it's 1:36 AM, good night!

Also, thought this was a lot? Go look at the [`updatelogs`](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/spark/blob/main/updatelogs/logs202510/10192025.md) for today!
