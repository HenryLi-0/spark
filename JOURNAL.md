## 10/13/2025 - Writing The Idea and Setting Project Scope!  

Today was generally just a super long write up of my idea/concept for what I want to make! Simply, I want to create something that enables the ability to create more, similarly to a 3D printer. However, if you have one CNC machine, why not have it able to do many CNC things at once? As in, if it can do additive manufacturing, why not subtractive manufacturing? With the ability to move objects? Basically, a 3D frame with a coreXY motion system with toolheads that can be changed. And yeah, the write up just has way more detail and stuff, check it out at [on the repo!](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/spark/blob/main/updatelogs/logs202510/10122025.md). (if i ever change this, just check for an `updatelogs` folder and navigate to today, 10/12/2025 (yes i know it's 1:37 AM on 10/13/2025 for me))

Anyways, this project is meant to challenge me to do something a bit outside my usual comfort zone! It's also to make me actually have something to work on and have fun building (since I've just been unmotivated and waiting for FRC build season the motivate me again at this point). So yeah, what better way than with programming, mechanical, and electrical!
